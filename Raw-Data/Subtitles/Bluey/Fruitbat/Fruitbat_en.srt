1
00:00:06,542 --> 00:00:07,458
Mum!

2
00:00:12,083 --> 00:00:13,125
Dad!

3
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:18,667
Bingo!

4
00:00:22,834 --> 00:00:25,959
- Bluey!

5
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:28,083
-Ehh... easy.

6
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:29,458
Ohh! Ohh!

7
00:00:29,542 --> 00:00:31,000
Bluey, easy!

8
00:00:31,834 --> 00:00:33,041
- Aah! Aah!

9
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:35,125
-Oh, not fair!

10
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:37,500
-How good's Pop Up Croc?
-Again!

11
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:39,709
No. Upstairs for bedtime.

12
00:00:39,792 --> 00:00:41,333
Nooooooo!

13
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,208
Oh, here we go.

14
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:46,208
Noooooo!

15
00:00:48,792 --> 00:00:49,792
-Ooh!
-Ooh!

16
00:00:49,917 --> 00:00:53,709
<i>This episode of </i>Bluey
<i>is called </i>Fruit Bat.

17
00:00:53,792 --> 00:00:56,333
All right, say goodnight to the animals.

18
00:00:56,417 --> 00:00:57,417
Goodnight, frogs.

19
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,208
Night, kangaroos,

20
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:01,250
Night, bilbies.

21
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:02,417
Night, fruit bats.

22
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,792
No, not "Night, fruit bats."

23
00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:06,250
They don't sleep at night.

24
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:07,291
They're octurnal.

25
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:08,583
Good knowledge, kid.

26
00:01:08,667 --> 00:01:12,083
You mean fruit bats don't need
to go to bed now?

27
00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:14,208
No. But you do.

28
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:16,417
Come on. Bedtime.

29
00:01:16,542 --> 00:01:19,208
I wish I was a fruit bat.

30
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:21,417
Well, fruit bats don't get
to do rocket ship.

31
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,125
Yeah! Rocket ship!

32
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:25,166
Okay, helmets.

33
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,166
Choo-choog.

34
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,166
Seatbelts!

35
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:28,166
-Click!
-Click!

36
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,166
Close the door.

37
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,500
-Clunk.
-Click.

38
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:31,500
Okay, push the button!

39
00:01:31,583 --> 00:01:32,500
-Boop!
-Boop!

40
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:39,375
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

41
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:41,041
Okay, shower time.

42
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:43,041
No! More rocket ship!

43
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:44,625
I don't need a shower.

44
00:01:44,709 --> 00:01:46,333
Yeah, you do, ya grub.

45
00:01:46,417 --> 00:01:48,166
Poahh!

46
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,667
Not fair!

47
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,625
I bet fruit bats
don't have to have showers.

48
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:55,083
Well, then they wouldn't
get to play penguins.

49
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:57,208
Yeah, penguins!

50
00:01:59,417 --> 00:02:00,750
Whee!

51
00:02:00,834 --> 00:02:01,709
Teeth time.

52
00:02:01,792 --> 00:02:03,667
Mum, look, I'm a penguin!

53
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,542
Whee!

54
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,250
Oh, wackadu!

55
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:11,208
Even though I don't
really need to do a wee,

56
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:13,208
I'm going to do one anyway.

57
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:15,125
Otherwise, I might wet the bed.

58
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:16,709
-That's very clever, Bingo.

59
00:02:16,792 --> 00:02:18,875
It's called a tactical wee.

60
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,750
-Not fair.

61
00:02:20,834 --> 00:02:23,333
I want to stay up like a fruit bat.

62
00:02:23,417 --> 00:02:25,750
Well, when the fruit bats
go to the toilet,

63
00:02:25,834 --> 00:02:27,750
they do it hanging upside down,

64
00:02:27,834 --> 00:02:30,625
so the wee just runs all over them.

65
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:32,125
-Blegh!
- Bleaghh!

66
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:33,625
I'd love that!

67
00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:35,834
I bet you would, you little grub!

68
00:02:35,917 --> 00:02:38,458
Whee! Whee!

69
00:02:38,542 --> 00:02:40,375
Come on. That's a daytime game.

70
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:43,250
Oh, I just want to be a fruit bat.

71
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:44,667
Yeah, yeah. I know.

72
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,959
But fruit bats don't get
to play the story game,

73
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:50,250
where I tell a story,
but pretend to fall asleep.

74
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:51,542
-Yeah!
-Ah!

75
00:02:52,834 --> 00:02:56,375
"So, the little puppy peeked
in the window,

76
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:58,792
and on the table was the most beautiful--"

77
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:02,792
-Wake up!
-Wake up!

78
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:05,000
Huh? What? What? Oh, sorry.

79
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:07,583
I think I must have just dozed off.

80
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:09,000
Now, where was I?

81
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:10,166
Oh, yeah.

82
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:14,875
"...the most beautiful
golden egg she'd ever seen.

83
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,166
So she climbed inside,

84
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:21,000
but out jumped a huge hairy--"

85
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:25,500
-Wake up!
-Wake up!

86
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:27,750
Aah! Aah! Spider!

87
00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:35,041
Aw! I'm not tired.

88
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:37,166
I know. Just try, okay?

89
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:39,500
It's not fair!

90
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,417
Night, Bluey.

91
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,166
Ugh!

92
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,291
Ohh!

93
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:48,375
I can't fall asleep!

94
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:51,500
Psst! Bingo, are you awake?

95
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:55,542
Hmph!

96
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:00,417
Bluey.

97
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,208
What am I gonna do with you, hey?

98
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:05,333
Let me stay up?

99
00:04:05,417 --> 00:04:06,625
Ehhh.

100
00:04:08,417 --> 00:04:11,125
What's Dad doing?

101
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:13,583
Hmm, I'd say he's dreaming

102
00:04:13,667 --> 00:04:16,208
about playing touch football
with his mates.

103
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:17,208
Really?

104
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:19,792
Yeah, he doesn't get to play
that much anymore,

105
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:22,041
so he keeps having dreams about it.

106
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:24,959
Why doesn't he get to play it
for real life?

107
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:27,333
Well, he's busy, sweetheart.

108
00:04:27,417 --> 00:04:29,750
Busy working and looking after you two.

109
00:04:29,834 --> 00:04:30,917
Oh.

110
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,166
Oh look! Did he just score a try?

111
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,208
I think he did.

112
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,792
Ooh, maybe I can <i>dream</i>
about being a fruit bat.

113
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,291
Well, you could give it a go.

114
00:04:42,792 --> 00:04:43,667
Night, Mum!

115
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,417
Oh, okay.

116
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,417
Night, honey.

117
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,834
Come on!

118
00:04:48,917 --> 00:04:50,583
Come on!

119
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,375
Dream about being a fruit bat!

120
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,792
It didn't work.

121
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:04,208
Oh, well, you tried.

122
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:05,500
Where'd Dad go?

123
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:06,875
He's outside.

124
00:05:08,667 --> 00:05:11,125
Dad!

125
00:05:15,417 --> 00:05:16,875
Dad!

126
00:05:18,417 --> 00:05:20,291
Daaad!

127
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,625
<i>♪ Na, na-na-na ♪</i>

128
00:05:26,834 --> 00:05:28,500
<i>♪ Na-na, na-na, na ♪</i>

129
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:32,500
<i>♪ La, la, la-la-la-la, la ♪</i>

130
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,250
<i>♪ La, la, la-la-la ♪</i>

131
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:36,792
Mine!

132
00:05:43,834 --> 00:05:45,041
Yes, mate, yes, mate, yes, mate!

133
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:46,417
- Kick it!
-Whoo-hoo!

134
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,792
Run, run!

135
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,750
Yeah!

136
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:51,250
Hey, Dad!

137
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:53,500
Hey, Bluey!

138
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:54,959
You're a fruit bat!

139
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:56,250
Yeah!

140
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:57,375
How is it?

141
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,834
It's great!

142
00:05:58,917 --> 00:06:01,333
You get to eat a lot of fruit!

143
00:06:01,417 --> 00:06:02,834
Ha! I bet.

144
00:06:02,917 --> 00:06:04,709
Hey, did you see my try?

145
00:06:04,792 --> 00:06:06,041
Yeah, I did!

146
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,542
How good was it?!

147
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:09,375
So good.

148
00:06:09,542 --> 00:06:11,959
There's plenty more where that came from!

149
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:13,959
- Yeah, ya reckon?
-Yeah, sure.

150
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:15,208
Yeah, I do.

151
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,375
Oh, righto!

152
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,000
All right, see ya, Bluey.

153
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:20,208
Come on, let's do this!

154
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:22,542
See ya, Dad!

155
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:31,375
Wow!

156
00:06:34,667 --> 00:06:35,583
Hi.

157
00:06:35,667 --> 00:06:37,125
Seven o'clock!

158
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:38,917
That was a big sleep.

159
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,917
I had the most amazing dream.

160
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,458
One, two, three, four...

161
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,208
-Dad?
-...five, six...

162
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:46,542
Yes, mate? ...seven...

163
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:47,917
Thanks for looking after us.

164
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,875
...eight, nine, ten!

165
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:50,875
You're welcome.

166
00:06:52,417 --> 00:06:54,291
I've got your favorite, Bluey--

167
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:55,583
fruit salad!

168
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,875
Yuck!

169
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,250
No more fruit.

170
00:06:58,333 --> 00:06:59,834
Just some toast, please.

171
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:02,166
Mm-mm-mnh.
