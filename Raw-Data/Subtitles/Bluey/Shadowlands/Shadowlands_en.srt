1
00:00:05,959 --> 00:00:06,875
Mum!

2
00:00:12,041 --> 00:00:12,875
Dad!

3
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:18,667
Bingo!

4
00:00:22,834 --> 00:00:25,000
- Bluey!

5
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:28,875
What's the time,
Mrs. Wolf?

6
00:00:28,959 --> 00:00:30,917
Seven o'clock!

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,667
One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven!

8
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,083
What's the time, Mrs. Wolf?!

9
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:40,875
Ten o'clock!

10
00:00:40,959 --> 00:00:42,750
Coco!

11
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:45,083
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine ten!

12
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:48,083
What's the time, Mrs. Wolf?

13
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:50,166
Dinnertime! Got you!

14
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,583
Coco!

15
00:00:51,667 --> 00:00:53,625
You always do this!

16
00:00:53,709 --> 00:00:54,709
Do what?

17
00:00:54,792 --> 00:00:57,417
Something to make
the game easy for you.

18
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,458
-Do I?
-Yes.

19
00:00:59,542 --> 00:01:02,208
Oh, sorry, Bluey.
I'll try and stop.

20
00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:04,500
What if we play
Shadowlands instead?

21
00:01:04,583 --> 00:01:05,500
Yeah!

22
00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:10,208
<i>This episode of </i>Bluey
<i>is called </i>Shadowlands.

23
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:11,792
What's Shadowlands?

24
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:12,917
It's fun.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,834
All the shadowy, grassy bits
are the land,

26
00:01:15,917 --> 00:01:18,250
and all the bits in the sun
is the sea.

27
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:20,417
Yeah, and there's crocodiles
in the sea.

28
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,250
Yeah,
you can't touch the water,

29
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:23,834
or you get bitten
by a crocodile.

30
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:27,291
So you can only walk
on the land?

31
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:28,583
These bits?

32
00:01:28,667 --> 00:01:33,208
Yeah, and we have to getnfrom here
to the picnic blanket.

33
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,709
All right!

34
00:01:34,792 --> 00:01:37,250
But you can't just
change the rules

35
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:39,625
to make it easy this time,
okay?

36
00:01:39,709 --> 00:01:40,917
No, I won't.

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,250
You promise?

38
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:43,500
I promise.

39
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:44,834
Okay, let's go!

40
00:01:44,917 --> 00:01:46,125
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

41
00:01:47,542 --> 00:01:48,500
Whoo!

42
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:00,792
This is fun!

43
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:02,667
I told you.

44
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,750
You won't get us, crocodile.

45
00:02:08,834 --> 00:02:11,291
Ooh! I can't jump that far.

46
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:12,959
Look at my little legs.

47
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:15,166
Well, maybe just this time,

48
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,500
you can have
crocodile-proof shoes.

49
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:18,625
Coco!

50
00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:20,709
Oh. Yeah. Sorry.

51
00:02:20,792 --> 00:02:23,000
But how is Snickers
gonna get over?

52
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:24,750
Umm...

53
00:02:24,834 --> 00:02:25,750
I know!

54
00:02:25,834 --> 00:02:27,709
Come here, Coco!

55
00:02:27,792 --> 00:02:29,583
Now get on my shoulders.

56
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:34,375
Go, Snickers!

57
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:37,625
Yeah! We did it!

58
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:39,583
Great idea, Bluey!

59
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:48,000
Hey, this bug
looks like bird poo.

60
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:49,792
[car alarm chirps,
engine starts]

61
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:52,792
Bluey, look out!

62
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:54,041
Bluey!

63
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:55,458
Bluey!

64
00:02:56,792 --> 00:02:58,333
Aaaaah!

65
00:02:59,417 --> 00:03:01,166
You're trapped.

66
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,959
How are you gonna
get across the river?

67
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:04,125
I don't know.

68
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:07,250
How about we just pretend
in this bit,

69
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,959
all the crocodiles are asleep?

70
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:12,709
You can't
change the rules, Coco!

71
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:14,667
Ohh! Why not?

72
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,291
Because they're the rules!

73
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:21,667
Look! A bus!

74
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:24,542
Are you ready, Bluey?

75
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:25,875
I'm ready!

76
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:27,834
Go!

77
00:03:27,917 --> 00:03:28,792
Aaaaah!

78
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,250
Go, Bluey!

79
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,250
Eeee-yaaaah!

80
00:03:34,834 --> 00:03:35,750
Yeah!

81
00:03:35,834 --> 00:03:37,375
That was so cool!

82
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:38,500
Come on!

83
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:40,959
We're almost
at the picnic blanket!

84
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:44,333
Be careful, everyone.

85
00:03:44,417 --> 00:03:47,125
This bridge is really skinny.

86
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:48,125
Wait!

87
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:49,417
-It's getting windy!

88
00:03:51,542 --> 00:03:53,542
The wind's making it move!

89
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:55,208
I can't stay on!

90
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:56,667
Aaaaah!

91
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,375
The crocodiles
are gonna get us!

92
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:00,417
What are we gonna do?!

93
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,792
Run!

94
00:04:04,542 --> 00:04:06,959
Phew! We made it!

95
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,208
But look.

96
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,625
There's no way
to get across the sea!

97
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,458
And we can't go back this way.

98
00:04:13,542 --> 00:04:16,583
We're trapped
on a palm tree island!

99
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:18,750
Oh, noooo!

100
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,709
The little critters
must be hungry.

101
00:04:22,792 --> 00:04:24,917
Oh, I brought something
for them.

102
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,542
Cupcakes!

103
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:31,250
Who wants cupcakes?

104
00:04:32,417 --> 00:04:34,125
Cupcakes!

105
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:36,041
They've got blue icing!

106
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,417
And sprinkles!

107
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,000
Sprinkles!

108
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:41,583
Why don't we just make it
so we can...

109
00:04:41,667 --> 00:04:42,875
walk on water?

110
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:45,083
No one can walk on water.

111
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:46,709
Water boatmen can.

112
00:04:46,792 --> 00:04:48,458
Well, we aren't water boatmen.

113
00:04:48,542 --> 00:04:50,208
We need to find another way.

114
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:54,792
I'm going to eat your cupcakes!

115
00:04:54,917 --> 00:04:56,000
No!

116
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:57,583
That's it!

117
00:04:57,667 --> 00:05:01,500
I'm gonna be a water boatman
and walk across this water

118
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:03,041
and have a cupcake.

119
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:04,750
No, Coco!

120
00:05:04,834 --> 00:05:06,917
-Arr-oooh!

121
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,333
But I want a cupcake!

122
00:05:09,417 --> 00:05:12,166
You can't just
change the rules!

123
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,709
But you still haven't
told me why!

124
00:05:15,792 --> 00:05:17,417
Well, because...

125
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:19,792
I don't know!

126
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:22,291
See? There's no reason.

127
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,500
Maybe Coco's right, Bluey.

128
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:27,625
Maybe we can just change
the rules an eensy bit?

129
00:05:27,709 --> 00:05:30,333
It'll still be Shadowlands.

130
00:05:30,834 --> 00:05:32,959
Okay.

131
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:39,125
Wait!

132
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:40,291
What is it?

133
00:05:40,417 --> 00:05:42,041
The wind is back.

134
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,125
Look!

135
00:05:44,542 --> 00:05:46,083
It's blowing the cloud.

136
00:05:46,834 --> 00:05:48,208
It's heading towards the sun.

137
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:56,709
Run!

138
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:59,417
Quick!

139
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:02,917
Hurry up, Snickers!

140
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,875
Run your little
sausage dog legs!

141
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:08,250
I can't run any faster!

142
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,542
Oof!

143
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:13,250
The crocodiles are coming!

144
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:15,125
Aaaaaaah!

145
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,667
We did it!

146
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,041
That was so much fun!

147
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:20,458
Yeah!

148
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:23,959
<i>That's </i>why you can't
change the rules--

149
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:26,083
because the rules make it fun!

150
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:27,875
Oh, yeah!

151
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:33,917
Kids and cupcakes, eh?

152
00:06:35,417 --> 00:06:38,250
A cupcake for each hand,
Snickers?

153
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:40,125
You got it made in the shade.

154
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,709
What's the time,
Mrs. Wolf?!

155
00:06:42,792 --> 00:06:44,667
Three o'clock!

156
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,959
One, two, three!

157
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,250
What's the time, Mrs. Wolf?!

158
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:51,709
Um...

159
00:06:51,792 --> 00:06:54,083
Maybe this one
will be dinnertime.

160
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:56,041
It won't.

161
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:58,542
Coco always waits until
we're right up next to her

162
00:06:58,625 --> 00:06:59,750
before she says--

163
00:06:59,834 --> 00:07:00,834
Dinnertime!
