What's today, kiddo?

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,291
It's the weekend?

10
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:42,291
That's right.

11
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,166
How many games should we play?

12
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,041
This many!

13
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:48,500
Whoa! Okay, that's doable.

14
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:50,625
I've got a letter for you!

15
00:00:50,709 --> 00:00:51,959
Oh, thanks Bluey.

16
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:53,458
What have we got here?

17
00:00:53,542 --> 00:00:54,542
It's a drumstick.

18
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:56,417
Oh, you beauty!

19
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,542

-You're not getting up, ever!
-Stay on him!

27
00:01:13,417 --> 00:01:15,834
You're not going anywhere,
you wild beast!

28
00:01:15,917 --> 00:01:18,250
I'm just going for a run!
I'll see you later.

00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:19,667

-See ya, Mum!

30
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,000
-Let me up!
-No, you're not getting up!

31
00:01:21,083 --> 00:01:22,041
I've got to give
your mum a kiss.

32
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:24,458
-Ooh!
-No smoochy kiss for you.

33

Oh, no!

00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:34,333
-Noooo! Get his legs, Bingo!
-Ahh! Come on!

38
00:01:34,417 --> 00:01:36,291
I just want to see this wicket.

39
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:40,458
Hey Bingo, you wanna
play statues?

40
00:01:40,542 --> 00:01:41,625
Yeah!

41
00:01:42,709 --> 00:01:44,417
How is that LBW?

42
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,667
-Dad!
- Coming!

43
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,667
Dad! Yeah, I'm coming!

44
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,250
-Daaad!
-Okay, okay.

<i>Bonjour!</i>

46
00:01:51,792 --> 00:01:54,250
Oh, hello. Would you like
to buy a statue?

47
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:57,375
Ah, yes, I definitely
would like to buy a statue.

48
00:01:57,458 --> 00:01:58,917
I-- Wait a minute.

49
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,875
These aren't
<i>magic </i>statues, are they?

50
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:04,500
Oh, no, these aren't magic.

51
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,458
These are just normal statues.

52
00:02:06,542 --> 00:02:09,709
Oh, good, 'cause I've been
down that road before.

53
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:11,667
Whoop, pause the game. Beep!

Well, you're welcome
to wait outside, kiddo.

58
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:24,625
Boop! Unpause.

59
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:26,625
Okay, I'd like that one, please.

60
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:28,667
Four hundred dollareedoos.

61
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,959
Thank you.

62
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:32,458
Enjoy your statuuue!

63
00:02:32,542 --> 00:02:35,625
Now, where am I gonna
put this statue?

64
00:02:35,709 --> 00:02:37,000
Ah, yes, just here.

65
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:38,792
Oh, I forgot my change.

66
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:39,750
Hi.

67
00:02:39,834 --> 00:02:41,583
I think I forgot my change.

68
00:02:41,667 --> 00:02:43,333
-Oh, yes, sir. Here you go.

69
00:02:43,417 --> 00:02:45,041
Thank you, shopkeeper.

70
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:47,125
I'll just get back
to my statue,

71
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,166
which I'm sure
is right over here.

72
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,792
-What?!

73
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:52,667
What's it doing over here?!

74
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,875
I could have sworn
I left it over there.

75
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,875
Oh, well. I guess
I'll just put it back.

76
00:02:59,542 --> 00:03:01,041
Is everything okay?

77
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:02,542
I think so.

78
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:04,959
I could have sworn I left
the statue here,

79
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:06,625
but I found it over there.

80
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:09,709
Well, you're probably just
going crazy or something.

81
00:03:09,792 --> 00:03:11,208
Oh, yes, probably.

82
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:12,333
Huh?

83
00:03:12,417 --> 00:03:13,792
What's going on here?

84
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:16,750
Where's my statue?!

85
00:03:16,834 --> 00:03:19,792
Hey, how did you get out here?

86
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:21,792
There's definitely
something weird going on.

87
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:22,875
Pbhhht!

88
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,750
What? Grrr!

89
00:03:24,834 --> 00:03:27,583
This <i>is </i>a magic statue!
I knew it!

90
00:03:27,667 --> 00:03:29,291
You sold me a magic statue!

91
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:31,041
-You get back here!

92
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:33,333
Grrrrr!

93
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:35,959
Where are you,
you little reprobates?

94
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:39,000
Oh, someone's at the door.

95
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:41,375
Hello!

96
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:42,792
Oh. What?

97
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:44,959
-That's strange.

98
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:47,333
-I thought someone rang the doorbell.

99
00:03:47,417 --> 00:03:49,375
Oh, well, I'll just
go back inside

100
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,792
and carry on
with my current tasks.

101
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:56,792
Hello?

102
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:57,875
Huh? What?

103
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:00,750
Well, that's twice now,
and there's no one here.

104
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,583
Certainly a very
strange occurrence.

105
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,375
I want to do it.

106
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:08,750
Okay. I'll help you.

107
00:04:08,834 --> 00:04:10,291
Ungh!

108
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,792
Almost!

109
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:13,208
-Ahh!

110
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:15,542
-Hello! Yarr!

111
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:18,208
-It was you kids all along!

112
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,625
-Where's my 400 dollareedoos?!

113
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:23,041
- Run, Bingo!

114
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:25,083
- Heel! Heel!
-Huh?

115
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:27,125
Is that a leaf?

116
00:04:28,834 --> 00:04:31,542
Are you a leaf?

117
00:04:31,709 --> 00:04:33,709
You look like a leaf,

118
00:04:33,792 --> 00:04:35,959
but you're walking.

119
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:38,750
Are you a walking leaf?

120
00:04:38,834 --> 00:04:41,291
But I don't understand.

121
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:44,750
Why would a leaf want to walk?

122
00:04:44,834 --> 00:04:47,709
You should be in a tree, leaf.

123
00:04:47,792 --> 00:04:50,375
Daddy, come and see!

124
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,000
Where are you going,
walking leaf?

125
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:56,583
Come here, Daddy! Quickly!

126
00:04:56,667 --> 00:04:59,000
-Give me back my dollareedoos!

127
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:00,875
Daddy, come and see.

128
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:01,917
Oh!

129
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,917
Goodbye.

130
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,917
Have fun.

131
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,333
I'll miss you.

132
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,542
-Mum!
-Where's my Bluey?

133
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:11,709
-Well, go on.

134
00:05:11,792 --> 00:05:13,250
Give your Mum a hug.
What are you waiting for?

135
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:14,667
Oh, Dad!

136
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,625
Oh! Sorry.

137
00:05:16,709 --> 00:05:17,917
Where's your sister?

138
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,083
There she is.

139
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,667
Ahhhh.

140
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,709
Is there more weekend tomorrow?

141
00:05:32,792 --> 00:05:34,166
There sure is.

142
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,625
Hooray!

143
00:05:35,709 --> 00:05:37,125
Night, sweetie.

144
00:05:38,834 --> 00:05:41,750
Already tucked in, Bingo,
you little star?

145
00:05:41,834 --> 00:05:44,667
-Oh, what's up?

146
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,542
- Psst, honey!

147
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,750
-Come up here.
-Yep, coming.

148
00:05:48,834 --> 00:05:50,917
Oh, and she's got sushi shoes,

149
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,333
and there's rice at the bottom

150
00:05:53,417 --> 00:05:55,583
to help the shoes stand up.

151
00:05:55,667 --> 00:05:57,291
-Hey, Bingo.

152
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:02,125
Daddy, you didn't come
and see the walking leaf.

153
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:03,583
Ah, I'm sorry.

154
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:04,667
I didn't hear you.

155
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,792
That's okay.

156
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:09,250
The thing is, I don't know
if you know this,

157
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:12,166
but I bought this statue today
from a shop,

158
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,208
and it turned out to be magic.

159
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,959
Yeah, every time
he would put it somewhere,

160
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:18,625
it would just
keep running away.

161
00:06:18,709 --> 00:06:20,750
Yeah, and then I went
to see the shopkeeper

162
00:06:20,834 --> 00:06:23,834
and tried to get my money back,
but she kept running away.

163
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:25,667
And he chased me
all around the yard.

164
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,709
I kept running away.

165
00:06:27,792 --> 00:06:31,291
Yeah, and I didn't even get
my 400 dollareedoos back.

166
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,291
So I'm sorry.

167
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:34,792
-Daddy?
-Yeah?

168
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:36,667
-It was me!
-What?

169
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,750
I was the statue!

170
00:06:38,834 --> 00:06:40,208
-What?!

171
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:41,500
You know what?

172
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:43,834
I did think you looked
a little bit familiar.

173
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,667
-Night.
-Night, Bingo.

174
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,917
Night night, Bingo.

175
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,875
-Daddy?
-Yes, mate?

176
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:54,834
Just leaves the door
open this much,

177
00:06:54,917 --> 00:06:57,125
so the leaf can come in.

178
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,750
No worries, kiddo.
