1
00:00:06,375 --> 00:00:07,291
Mum!

2
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:13,083
Dad!

3
00:00:17,917 --> 00:00:18,834
Bingo!

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,125
- Bluey!

5
00:00:33,709 --> 00:00:35,625
Please come in.

6
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:39,125
Oh, your Dad's here, Bingo.

7
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:40,542
Dad!

8
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:41,458
Bingo!

9
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:42,750
Ohh!

10
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:44,458
Oh, that was a hard one.

11
00:00:44,542 --> 00:00:46,125
Dad! Dad!

12
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:47,709
Exciting news!

13
00:00:47,792 --> 00:00:48,792
What's that?

14
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:50,875
It's my turn to bring Bob Bilby home!

15
00:00:50,959 --> 00:00:52,500
Oh, wow!

16
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:55,083
He's a bilby, and his name is Bob.

17
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:57,542
Bob, this is my Dad.

18
00:00:57,625 --> 00:00:59,667
He's not actually real.

19
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,583
He's a puppet.

20
00:01:01,667 --> 00:01:04,458
You have to fold his ears
down when you say that.

21
00:01:04,542 --> 00:01:05,667
Oh, okay.

22
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,041
Hi, Bob.
Nice to meet you.

23
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:11,083
Well, let's you get back home
and show you around.

24
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:20,291
<i>This episode of </i>Bluey
<i>is called </i>Bob Bilby.

25
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:23,875
I took Bob Bilby home
when I was at kindy.

26
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:25,458
Do you remember that, Bingo?

27
00:01:25,542 --> 00:01:28,125
Um, ah, yeah, I think so.

28
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:30,917
Bob stays with us for the weekend,

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,083
and we take photos of all
the fun stuff we get up to,

30
00:01:34,166 --> 00:01:36,542
and then we stick them
in the Bob Bilby book.

31
00:01:36,625 --> 00:01:39,834
This is Bob at Jasper W.'s house.

32
00:01:39,917 --> 00:01:42,458
And this is with Harley.

33
00:01:42,542 --> 00:01:44,750
Ooh, you did a bit of karate, Bob.

34
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:47,417
Oh, wakadu.

35
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,250
I won't be messing with you.

36
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:53,250
And this is when he went
on a holiday with Mrs. Terrier.

37
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:57,125
Oh, yes, she took Bob with her
when she went to Scotland.

38
00:01:57,208 --> 00:01:59,458
Wow, Bob, you've really
been around.

39
00:01:59,542 --> 00:02:01,834
I hope we can show you
a good time, too.

40
00:02:01,917 --> 00:02:03,291
What do you reckon, kids?

41
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:04,917
Yeah!

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
-Hey! That's mine! Let go!

43
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:09,583
-No, Bob, that's Dad's.
-Grrr!

44
00:02:09,667 --> 00:02:12,000
Careful, Dad,
he knows karate.

45
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:14,458
Okay, I'll take
the photo now.

46
00:02:14,542 --> 00:02:15,583
Come on, moo cow!

47
00:02:15,667 --> 00:02:17,000
Walk over here!

48
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:19,583
Moo --Ah! Eee! Ah!

49
00:02:19,667 --> 00:02:21,333
Moo!

50
00:02:21,417 --> 00:02:23,417
Okay, smile, Bob!

51
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,333
-Ohhh!

52
00:02:25,417 --> 00:02:26,792
Let me see!

53
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:34,166
Bob, this is the tablet.

54
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,083
-You can take photos with it

55
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:37,834
and watch cartoons

56
00:02:37,917 --> 00:02:39,583
-and play games.

57
00:02:39,667 --> 00:02:41,625
Let's show Bob that game
where you give

58
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:43,458
Santa's beard a haircut.

59
00:02:43,542 --> 00:02:44,625
-Yeah!

60
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:48,792
-Not too long on that, kids.

61
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:58,834
Don't you want to teach Bob
some car games?

62
00:02:58,917 --> 00:03:01,333
Cartoooons!

63
00:03:01,417 --> 00:03:03,667
All right, there you go.

64
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,083
Yeah!

65
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:07,458
♪ <i>Yeah, yeah, baby </i>♪

66
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:12,041
Okay, who wants to be in charge
of the shopping list?

67
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,166
Bob?

68
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,875
♪ <i>Yeah, yeah, baby </i>♪

69
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,834
Bob, this is
Mixed Up Murphy.

70
00:03:16,917 --> 00:03:19,291
He's really funny.

71
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:20,875
Yeah, really funny.

72
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:23,583
<i>Running down the wing...</i>

73
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:33,667
♪ <i>Yeah, yeah, baby </i>♪

74
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,458
Kids, that's enough
of that thing.

75
00:03:35,542 --> 00:03:36,792
I'm sure Bob is sick of --

76
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:40,208
-Noooooo!
-Ah, whatever.

77
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:51,208
Kids, I'm putting our
photos in Bob Bilby's book!

78
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:53,291
Cool! Let us see!

79
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,291
These are just all of Bob
watching cartoons.

80
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:05,291
Oh, wow.

81
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:06,917
Yep.

82
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,458
He doesn't look like
he's having much fun.

83
00:04:09,542 --> 00:04:11,875
No, he doesn't, does he?

84
00:04:16,417 --> 00:04:18,333
♪ <i>Yeah, yeah, baby </i>♪

85
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,333
Oh, Bingo!

86
00:04:26,709 --> 00:04:28,458
Are you all right, Bingo?

87
00:04:28,542 --> 00:04:30,417
This is the most boring time

88
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,709
Bob's had in the whole book.

89
00:04:32,792 --> 00:04:35,458
Now, that's not true, kiddo.

90
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:36,834
Yeah, it is.

91
00:04:36,917 --> 00:04:39,667
I'm the worst friend Bob's got.

92
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,625
He's never going to want to visit again.

93
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,542
Ohhh!

94
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:46,959
Okay. Let's sort this out.

95
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:49,375
What's the best move right now? Hmm.

96
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:50,500
I know!

97
00:04:53,542 --> 00:04:59,542
Bob just copies whatever it is we do,
and we were only doing boring stuff.

98
00:04:59,709 --> 00:05:03,208
So all we need to do
is really exciting stuff.

99
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:04,917
Yeah.

100
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,291
But how are we gonna take
a photo without the tablet?

101
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,625
Ah, leave that to me.

102
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,458
This is all my stuff from
when I used to be cool.

103
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:16,500
Ah, here it is.

104
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,375
What is that?

105
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:20,917
This is what a <i>real </i>camera looks like.

106
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,250
Are you ready, Bob?

107
00:05:27,667 --> 00:05:30,166
- Ooh!

108
00:05:35,417 --> 00:05:37,709
- Yay! Eee!

109
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,792
Whee!

110
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,291
Wheeee! Hee!

111
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:05,166
Ooh!

112
00:06:14,667 --> 00:06:18,709
And this is Bob visiting
Daddy's friend Stevo.

113
00:06:18,792 --> 00:06:22,792
He let Bob turn the siren on,
but it was very loud.

114
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:26,417
And this is Bob and I getting
a book out of the library.

115
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,083
The end.

116
00:06:29,542 --> 00:06:31,375
Well Bingo, it looks like

117
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:34,375
Bob has had a wonderful time
staying with you.

118
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:37,208
Now, why don't you give Bob to Missy.

119
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:39,250
It's her turn with him next.

120
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,291
There you go, Bob.

121
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:45,792
Thanks for coming to visit me.

122
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:50,000
I hope you'd like to visit me again.

123
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:52,542
Goodbye.
