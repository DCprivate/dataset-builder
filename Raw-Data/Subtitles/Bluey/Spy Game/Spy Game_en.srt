1
00:00:06,333 --> 00:00:07,250
Mum!

2
00:00:12,125 --> 00:00:13,041
Dad!

3
00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:18,792
Bingo!

4
00:00:22,834 --> 00:00:25,959
- Bluey!

5
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:28,959
Bunkers, can you
get me a drink, please?

6
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:30,625
Coming, honey.

7
00:00:30,709 --> 00:00:32,458
Hey, can you grab us
the onions?

8
00:00:32,542 --> 00:00:34,000
Get 'em yourself.

9
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:35,375
Oh, yeah,
that's real friendly.

10
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:45,417
-Oh!

11
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,959
<i>This episode of </i>Bluey
<i>is called </i>Spy Game.

12
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:52,208
I got my mum!

13
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:53,959
I got Chloe's dad!

14
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:56,583
Stop!
What's the password?

15
00:00:56,667 --> 00:00:57,875
Um...

16
00:00:57,959 --> 00:00:59,166
Zebra.

17
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,000
-Zebra.
-Correct. You may enter.

18
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:05,625
Here's the samples,
Bingo.

19
00:01:05,709 --> 00:01:07,625
My name is Sparkleshot.

20
00:01:07,709 --> 00:01:09,291
-Come on, Bingo.
-Grr!

21
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:11,291
Now, I'm gonna go
and get Dad's sample.

22
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:13,166
Bluey, can I get Dad?

23
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,000
No, Mackenzie and I are the spies.

24
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:17,083
Your job is to gather grass
for the potion.

25
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:18,166
Aw!

26
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,583
What if we don't need a potion?

27
00:01:20,667 --> 00:01:23,083
What about if we use this wand instead?

28
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,875
I already told you.

29
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:27,875
Only potion grass can control grown-ups.

30
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:29,625
-Oh yeah, that's right.

31
00:01:29,709 --> 00:01:32,875
So, you go and get
some more potion grass, Bingo.

32
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,166
Yeah, yeah?

33
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:35,458
Okay.

34
00:01:35,542 --> 00:01:37,333
Let's go, Mackenzie!

35
00:01:37,417 --> 00:01:41,458
New password is, uh, "diplodocus!"

36
00:01:41,542 --> 00:01:43,625
Where's that sausage tray gone?

37
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:45,125
You don't know what you're doing.

38
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:46,625
Oh, you're burning them.
You're burning them!

39
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:48,542
They'll be right.

40
00:01:50,917 --> 00:01:52,166
Dad!

41
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,917
I need the toilet.
I'm busting.

42
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,291
Hey, what are you kids
doing down there?

43
00:01:57,375 --> 00:01:58,709
Bingo!

44
00:01:58,792 --> 00:02:00,959
You're meant to be getting potion grass.

45
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:03,625
I don't want to collect
potion grass anymore.

46
00:02:03,709 --> 00:02:06,333
And my name is Sparkleshot.

47
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:08,500
Grr, you're not
playing spies anymore.

48
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:09,709
Good.

49
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:11,333
Come on, Bingo.

50
00:02:11,417 --> 00:02:13,542
Don't turn those top ones yet!

51
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:14,917
Good riddance.

52
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,625
Oh, who's gonna get
the potion grass?

53
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:19,709
Password!

54
00:02:19,792 --> 00:02:21,166
Diplodocus.

55
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,917
Bingo's not playing anymore.

56
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,500
Honey, you have to get
the potion grass now.

57
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:27,583
What? But I'm a guard!

58
00:02:27,667 --> 00:02:28,542
Not anymore.

59
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:29,583
Aw.

60
00:02:29,667 --> 00:02:31,542
Uh, Chloe,

61
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:33,458
do you mind getting the potion grass?

62
00:02:33,542 --> 00:02:36,750
Um, no thanks.
I like being a guard, too.

63
00:02:36,834 --> 00:02:39,917
But I can shout "password"
the loudest, though.

64
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,834
- Passwoooord!

65
00:02:42,917 --> 00:02:45,750
What if we don't need potion grass?

66
00:02:45,834 --> 00:02:48,542
We just use...
this chip packet.

67
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:49,834
That won't work.

68
00:02:49,917 --> 00:02:52,542
It might.
They're barbecue flavor.

69
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:54,542
And the parents
<i>are </i>having a barbecue.

70
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:56,208
Let's try it.

71
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:00,542
-But who's gonna stand guard?
-Whoo! Whoo!

72
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:03,208
You do it, Bluey.
I'm off to spy.

73
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:04,375
Hey, what?

74
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:07,166
But I'm a spy!

75
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:10,667
Hmph.
The password is "grumpy."

76
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,542
<i>♪ One man went to mow ♪</i>

77
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,583
<i>♪ Went to mow a meadow ♪</i>

78
00:03:14,667 --> 00:03:16,500
<i>♪ One man and his dog ♪</i>
Arf!

79
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:18,500
<i>♪ Went to mow a meadow ♪</i>

80
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:20,375
How you going in there, Bingo?

81
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:22,333
I can feel my sausages burning.

82
00:03:22,417 --> 00:03:26,375
I started just doing a wee,
and now it's turned into a poo.

83
00:03:27,834 --> 00:03:29,417
<i>♪ Two men went to mow ♪</i>

84
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,375
<i>♪ Went to mow a meadow ♪</i>

85
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:39,583
I got the hairs!

86
00:03:39,667 --> 00:03:41,333
Okay, now you
stand guard, Mackenzie,

87
00:03:41,417 --> 00:03:42,625
and I'll go get some more.

88
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:44,917
Chloe's almost finished the spell!

89
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,542
Let's put this pinecone in, too.

90
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:49,000
Peshoo!
It's ready!

91
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:52,000
Whee! Now we can control the grown ups!

92
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:53,458
I'm first!

93
00:03:53,542 --> 00:03:55,417
Okay, Bluey's mum.

94
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,333
Get up and dance around.

95
00:03:58,417 --> 00:04:01,166
Whoo-hoo!

96
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,458
Go, baby!

97
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:05,166
No, not Honey's mum.

98
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,291
I said, "Bluey's mum."

99
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:09,667
It's not working properly.

100
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,083
-Let me try!
-Yow!

101
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:13,291
-I'm going first!
-Let me try! Yow!

102
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:14,542
I can do it!

103
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:16,333
Maybe we need another pinecone.

104
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:21,375
Little bit more.
Little bit more.

105
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:24,125
Hey, Bluey.
You need the toilet, too?

106
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:26,500
No one's playing
the game properly.

107
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,458
Ah, is this the spy game?

108
00:04:28,542 --> 00:04:31,125
Yeah, no one's
doing their jobs.

109
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:32,542
And when did this
start happening?

110
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:35,041
Hmm, it started when...

111
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:36,458
Bingo stopped playing.

112
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:37,709
Finished!

113
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:43,333
Check this out.
We're dogs, kid.

114
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:46,000
We all have a place in the pack.

115
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:50,250
Now, look what happens
when I take the bottom one out.

116
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,125
Does that make sense?

117
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:54,333
No.

118
00:04:54,417 --> 00:04:56,417
Okay, just do your best, kid.

119
00:04:58,917 --> 00:05:02,458
This one...
and this one.

120
00:05:02,542 --> 00:05:04,166
And this one.

121
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,041
Bingo, can you come
and play with us again?

122
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,000
Bluey, I'm Sparkleshot.

123
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:14,000
I've told you this before.

124
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,500
Sorry.

125
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:16,792
Do you still want to play?

126
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:19,458
Well, can I get to do a spy?

127
00:05:19,542 --> 00:05:21,166
Well, no.

128
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,625
Aw!

129
00:05:22,709 --> 00:05:26,333
But I promise, I'll think
of something really fun.

130
00:05:26,417 --> 00:05:27,542
Okay.

131
00:05:28,792 --> 00:05:31,291
- Mackenzie!
- I'm going first!

132
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:33,250
-No, no, I can do it!

133
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,458
-Honey!
-Let me try.

134
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:36,333
My turn first!

135
00:05:36,417 --> 00:05:38,583
It's not working properly!

136
00:05:38,667 --> 00:05:41,125
Look who's back!

137
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:42,583
Bingo!

138
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:46,959
Okay, here's the plan.

139
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:49,959
Mackenzie, you and me
are going to do the last spy.

140
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:52,000
Honey and Chloe, stand guard.

141
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:54,667
And Bingo, you get the potion grass.

142
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,041
Yeah!

143
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:57,834
He was
thinking, "I'm not going,"

144
00:05:57,917 --> 00:06:00,333
-and I was like, "Yes, you are."

145
00:06:00,417 --> 00:06:02,250
-Ahh, mozzie!

146
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,709
Password!

147
00:06:07,792 --> 00:06:09,333
Sweetie, we need
the sausage tray.

148
00:06:09,417 --> 00:06:11,000
Password!

149
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:12,875
Uh, "sausage tray?"

150
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:15,500
Wrong! That's not the password!

151
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,625
Aw, never mind,
I'll use something else.

152
00:06:17,709 --> 00:06:19,542
I'm going first.

153
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:21,959
-No, I'm going first!
-No, me!

154
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:23,834
I know how to do it.

155
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:25,542
I'm going fiiiirst!

156
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:28,750
Nooo, Bingo's going first.

157
00:06:28,834 --> 00:06:30,333
For real life?

158
00:06:30,417 --> 00:06:31,709
For real life.

159
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:33,375
Oh, thanks, Bluey.

160
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:35,166
-Go, Bingo!
-Yeah!

161
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,458
-Yeah, Bingo!
-Go, Bingo!

162
00:06:36,542 --> 00:06:38,750
Okay, grown-ups...

163
00:06:38,834 --> 00:06:40,458
go crazy!

164
00:06:47,542 --> 00:06:50,250
-Whoa! It worked!

165
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:51,625
Well done, Bingo --

166
00:06:51,709 --> 00:06:54,166
ooh, I mean Sparkleshot.

167
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:56,500
Nice one, Bandit.

168
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:57,709
Get him!

169
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:01,291
Looks like
we're gonna have pizza, kids!
