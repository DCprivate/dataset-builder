1
00:00:06,125 --> 00:00:07,041
Mum!

2
00:00:11,917 --> 00:00:12,875
Dad!

3
00:00:17,709 --> 00:00:18,625
Bingo!

4
00:00:22,792 --> 00:00:25,917
- Bluey!

5
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:40,583
You sure you don't want some help?

6
00:00:40,667 --> 00:00:42,417
No.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,709
So close!

8
00:00:49,792 --> 00:00:53,792
<i>This episode of </i>Bluey
<i>is called </i>Bike.

9
00:00:58,083 --> 00:01:00,667
Humph!
It's not fair!

10
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,875
Why can't I just
do it straightaway?

11
00:01:02,959 --> 00:01:05,083
That's not how the world works, kid.

12
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:06,917
Then the world is silly!

13
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:09,667
Can't argue with that.

14
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,583
I'm never riding that bike again!

15
00:01:12,667 --> 00:01:13,792
Okay.

16
00:01:21,792 --> 00:01:23,083
Ooh.

17
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,333
Ooh!

18
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:28,875
Eee!

19
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:33,500
Oh. The button is unpressing.

20
00:01:36,417 --> 00:01:38,500
Almost.

21
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:41,875
Ohhhh!

22
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:43,333
Oh, poor Bingo.

23
00:01:43,417 --> 00:01:45,417
She'll figure it out.

24
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,750
Hey, look at Bentley!

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,625
I can't reach!

26
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:51,875
Oh. She can't reach the monkey bars.

27
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:54,959
Ooooh!

28
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:02,458
Aww!

29
00:02:02,542 --> 00:02:04,083
Hey, look at your cousin Muffin.

30
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,000
Finished my water!

31
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:09,542
Put it in my backpack!

32
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:12,458
Put my backpack on my back!

33
00:02:12,542 --> 00:02:14,333
One arm through.

34
00:02:14,417 --> 00:02:16,083
Now the other one.

35
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:22,291
Come here, strap!

36
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:23,875
She can't get the bag on.

37
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:26,291
Oh, Muffin,
the strap's just there!

38
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:28,208
Just stick your arm through.

39
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:30,333
Look, Bingo's having another go.

40
00:02:35,917 --> 00:02:36,917
Go, Bingo! Faster!

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,208
Come on, Bingo!

42
00:02:39,834 --> 00:02:41,125
Come on, Bingo.

43
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:43,542
Come on, Bingo!

44
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:44,542
Oh!

45
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:45,542
Almost!

46
00:02:48,792 --> 00:02:50,000
Oof!

47
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:51,333
That's it!

48
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:54,834
Oh, she's gonna try to jump.

49
00:02:54,917 --> 00:02:56,291
Okay, here she goes.

50
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:58,166
Yay! Jumping!

51
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,583
Ohhhhh!

52
00:03:00,667 --> 00:03:01,834
Ow!

53
00:03:01,917 --> 00:03:03,375
She's okay.

54
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:04,917
Whoa!
Look at Muffin!

55
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,917
Waaa-aaa-aaa-aaa-aaa-aah!

56
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,834
Ah, don't spin 'round, Muffin!

57
00:03:09,917 --> 00:03:12,291
Daddle-daddle-daddle-daddle!

58
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:13,625
Ooh!

59
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:14,959
-Ah, she's dizzy!

60
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,000
Ha ha!

61
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,959
Whoooa!

62
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:20,959
-Oh!
-Ooh!

63
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:25,917
Oh, boy.
Here comes the meltdown.

64
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,208
Waaaaah!

65
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:30,750
This is unacceptable!

66
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,166
Why won't you
go on my back, you bag?!

67
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:44,834
Whoa!
Look at Bentley!

68
00:03:44,917 --> 00:03:46,792
Here she goes.

69
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:48,083
Jumping!

70
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:49,917
-Oh! So close!
-Aww!

71
00:03:52,834 --> 00:03:55,166
Why can't I do it straightaway?!

72
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:58,375
Hey!
That's what <i>I </i>said!

73
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,667
Oww!

74
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,917
Aww.

75
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,250
I can't do it.

76
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:09,959
I'll never be able
to drink water again.

77
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:13,667
And then <i>I </i>curled
into a little ball, too.

78
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,667
Poor Bingo.

79
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,667
I'll go and hold the button for her.

80
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,500
Hang on.
Not so fast.

81
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:21,125
Let's just see
what happens next.

82
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:55,834
What's she doing?

83
00:05:00,542 --> 00:05:01,875
Oooh!

84
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,750
What?!

85
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:12,834
Wait a minute.

86
00:05:12,917 --> 00:05:14,417
She's got an idea!

87
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,750
Muffin's going for it.

88
00:05:15,834 --> 00:05:17,875
Come on, Muffin!

89
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:19,250
You can do it, Muffin!

90
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:20,500
Go, Muffin!

91
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:21,458
Look at Bentley!

92
00:05:23,667 --> 00:05:24,875
Go, Bentley!

93
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:27,250
Go, Bentley!

94
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,375
Look at the focus!

95
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,834
She's gonna do it.

96
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:35,125
She's gonna do it!

97
00:05:38,667 --> 00:05:40,625
Go, Bentley!
You can do it!

98
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,583
Yes!

99
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:46,709
Go, Muffin!

100
00:05:46,792 --> 00:05:47,875
Yeah!

101
00:05:48,917 --> 00:05:50,208
Got it!

102
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:51,583
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

103
00:05:51,667 --> 00:05:53,000
Good one, Muffin.

104
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:54,583
Yeah, good one, Muffin!

105
00:05:54,667 --> 00:05:56,792
Yeah!

106
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:58,834
Almost.

107
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,375
Yep! Got it!

108
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:02,875
Yeah!

109
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:04,583
Go, Bentley!

110
00:06:04,667 --> 00:06:06,166
Yes!

111
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,917
You beauty!

112
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,667
That was great!

113
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,667
I'd like to get down now.

114
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:13,792
Whoo!

115
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,458
How's Bingo doing?

116
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:23,333
-Oh! Bingo!
-Oh, Bingo!

117
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:24,792
That's disgusting!

118
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,709
That's less than ideal.

119
00:06:26,792 --> 00:06:28,875
But it's still a win.

120
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:30,417
Nice work, Bingo!

121
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:53,458
Nice work, Bluey.
