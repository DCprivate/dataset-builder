1
00:00:06,291 --> 00:00:07,250
Mum!

2
00:00:12,041 --> 00:00:13,083
Dad!

3
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:18,667
Bingo!

4
00:00:22,834 --> 00:00:25,000
- Bluey!

5
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,041
Grr, come on!

6
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,166
Oh, come on!

7
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,458
-Come on, start!
-Start!

8
00:00:44,542 --> 00:00:46,250
-Come on, ya heap o' junk!
-Come on!

9
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:47,667
Heap o' junk!

10
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:48,750
-Whoosh!

11
00:00:48,834 --> 00:00:50,333
-There it goes!
-There it goes!

12
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:53,583
<i>This episode of </i>Bluey
<i>is called </i>BBQ.

13
00:00:53,667 --> 00:00:54,542
-Okay.

14
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:55,709
You've got to.

15
00:00:55,792 --> 00:00:56,709
And they're blowing the whistle,

16
00:00:56,792 --> 00:00:58,083
the farmer's yelling,

17
00:00:58,166 --> 00:00:59,500
"It's dog versus sheep!"

18
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:00,917
Oh, wow!

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,959
Don't you hate that dog shampoo?

20
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:04,792
But it does get the ticks.

21
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:13,959
There. Table's set.

22
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:16,333
Almost ready with the sausages, kids!

23
00:01:16,417 --> 00:01:18,375
I love sausages!

24
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:20,917
Ruff, ruff, rowwrrr!

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,250
This is my relaxer chair.

26
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,417
It's where I relax.

27
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,166
Ahh! So relaxing.

28
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,166
Tell me about it.

29
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,333
Bandit had one on the back
of his ear the other day.

30
00:01:31,417 --> 00:01:33,709
He kept going, "Ooh! Ooh!"

31
00:01:36,834 --> 00:01:40,375
We have to have salad with our barbecue!

32
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:41,625
You're right, Muffin!

33
00:01:41,709 --> 00:01:44,000
Bingo, can you be in charge of the salads?

34
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:49,959
Well, I was relaxing
in my relaxing chair, but okay.

35
00:01:50,667 --> 00:01:52,375
Ooh, that sun is hot.

36
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:54,542
-Can I borrow this, Dad?
-Hey!

37
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:57,750
Okay, this is the salad bowl.

38
00:01:57,834 --> 00:02:00,250
Ahhhh!

39
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:03,083
You need to put salad in it!

40
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:04,500
R-R-R-Rowwrrr!

41
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,917
I like pepper salad!

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Ooh, me too. I love peppers.

43
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:11,917
Rowrr, rowrr! Gleen pepper!

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,125
Socks said she likes
green peppers the best.

45
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:18,917
Ooh! Oh, okay.

46
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,959
I can get green pepper.

47
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:22,583
Green is easy.

48
00:02:22,667 --> 00:02:25,291
-Aah! Thorns!

49
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:26,500
Oh, here we go.

50
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:27,917
-Eeeeeeeeeeeee...
-Eee, bug!

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,458
-...eee!
-He was going-- Yaah!

52
00:02:29,542 --> 00:02:31,000
-Get it off!

53
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:33,458
Oh, this one's okay.

54
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:38,125
There. Green pepper salad.

55
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:42,250
Ahh. So relaxing.

56
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:44,250
Can I have some yellow pepper?

57
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:46,583
Yellow's my favorite color pepper.

58
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:51,417
Hmm, yellow pepper.

59
00:02:56,667 --> 00:02:57,583
Eh!

60
00:02:57,667 --> 00:02:58,583
Unh!

61
00:02:58,667 --> 00:02:59,750
Almost.

62
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:02,959
He doesn't listen to the farmer.

63
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:04,375
He goes straight for the sheep.

64
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:05,625
-Oh, no way!
-Just borrowing this, Dad!

65
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:07,208
Gets five of them. They're up over.

66
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:08,875
They're in the truck.

67
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,333
-Hey!

68
00:03:10,417 --> 00:03:13,667
Unh, it's so heavy!

69
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,333
There!

70
00:03:15,417 --> 00:03:18,458
-That's not safe, Bingo.
-Aah, aah, Mum!

71
00:03:19,834 --> 00:03:20,834
Hmm.

72
00:03:20,917 --> 00:03:21,875
Ooh!

73
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:23,583
Unh!

74
00:03:23,667 --> 00:03:24,917
And then --hey!

75
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:27,083
Bingo!

76
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:28,542
Got it!

77
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,041
Sorry, Dad!

78
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:32,625
Here you go-- yellow pepper.

79
00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:34,333
Ruff! Rowrr!

80
00:03:34,417 --> 00:03:37,000
<i>Now </i>I'm gonna relax.

81
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,583
Ahhh!

82
00:03:39,667 --> 00:03:43,542
My favorite color pepper is red pepper.

83
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:46,625
Red pepper?

84
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:49,458
There's no red plants
around, though, Muffin.

85
00:03:49,542 --> 00:03:53,375
Yes, there is-- in that tree.

86
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:55,333
Oh, yeah! The Poinciana.

87
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,208
Aah! Aah!

88
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:02,709
Aaaah!

89
00:04:02,792 --> 00:04:05,041
Red pepper!

90
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:06,667
I mean-- Oh!

91
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,291
Bingo, what are you doing?

92
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:11,291
I'm making a salad!

93
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:12,333
Okay!

94
00:04:12,417 --> 00:04:14,500
Yaah!

95
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:16,250
Yeah!

96
00:04:17,667 --> 00:04:20,250
There!

97
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,875
-Red pepper.
-Yeah!

98
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:26,083
I don't think there's
any more colors of pepper.

99
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:29,333
So now... I'm only...

100
00:04:29,417 --> 00:04:30,500
I'm just gonna...

101
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:33,291
relax in my... relaxer chair.

102
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:37,500
Ooh, I like that salad dressing, Chilli.

103
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,333
Yeah, thanks. I made it myself.

104
00:04:39,417 --> 00:04:41,000
It's Aunty Mary's recipe.

105
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:46,417
We need salad dressing!

106
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,291
Oooowwrrr!

107
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:51,542
Ahhh, okay.

108
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:52,875
-So, what'd you do?
-Well --

109
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,041
Can I borrow this, Dad?

110
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:55,250
-Hey!

111
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:59,166
Mud. All mine.

112
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,709
Oh, we're out of mud.

113
00:05:00,792 --> 00:05:02,291
I will make some more.

114
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:09,166
Dad, which way do I turn on the hose?!

115
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,458
Urghh! Dad!

116
00:05:11,542 --> 00:05:12,875
Yes, Bingo!

117
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:15,291
-Oh!

118
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:17,500
Don't worry! I got it working!

119
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:22,041
There. Now I'll fill up my jar.

120
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:24,875
I'll just put this down here.

121
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:29,500
-It's raining.

122
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:33,250
Bingo, what are you doing down there?!

123
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,041
Bingo, grab the hose!

124
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:38,041
I'm trying! Aaaah!

125
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:42,208
It's tickling my bottom!

126
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,000
-Forget the hose!

127
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:45,375
Turn off the tap!

128
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,333
- No, no, no!

129
00:05:47,417 --> 00:05:49,667
The other way. Right to tight!

130
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,166
Got it!

131
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,041
- Yeah!
- Awoooo!

132
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:55,250
My goodness!

133
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:56,917
This is not relaxing.

134
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,333
Salad dressing!

135
00:06:01,417 --> 00:06:06,625
Now, I'm going to sit
in my relaxer chair and relax!

136
00:06:06,709 --> 00:06:08,083
Hmph!

137
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:10,750
Whose muddy footprints are these?!

138
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,750
More sausages, please, Bluey.

139
00:06:17,834 --> 00:06:18,667
Here ya go.

140
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,709
Thank you.

141
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:25,125
Phew! Finally, I get to relax!

142
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:27,291
Ahhhh!

143
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:28,959
Sausages are ready!

144
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:31,792
- Sausages!
- Awooo!

145
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:33,208
Ohhh!

146
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,792
Out of the way, salads.

147
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:38,792
-Ohh, looks good, Bandit!
-Ooh!

148
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:41,166
Well done. They look delicious, Bandit.

149
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,917
Why, thank you. Thank you very much.

150
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,959
Isn't anyone going to mention the salads?!

151
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,542
Check it out, kids.
Look how good they look.

152
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:54,750
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

153
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:01,041
Thanks, Bingo. Now relax.

154
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:02,166
Yum, yum, yum!
