1
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:07,208
Mum!

2
00:00:11,834 --> 00:00:12,917
Dad!

3
00:00:17,792 --> 00:00:18,709
Bingo!

4
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:25,959
Bluey!

5
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:30,375
Here comes the mountain climber!

6
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:31,792
-Is she gonna... ugh --
-Eeeh!

7
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:33,041
...get to the top?

8
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:35,375
She made it!

9
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:36,542
I made it!

10
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:39,625
Uh-oh! It's getting windy!

11
00:00:39,709 --> 00:00:41,417
-It's getting windy!
-Go, Bingo!

12
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,500
Oh! She's fallen down!

13
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:44,500
-Again, again!

14
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:45,875
Do that to me!

15
00:00:45,959 --> 00:00:47,333
Oh, man!

16
00:00:47,417 --> 00:00:49,625
Is there some game
where I just lie really still

17
00:00:49,709 --> 00:00:52,291
on a comfy bed or something?

18
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:53,583
Hospitals!

19
00:00:53,667 --> 00:00:56,083
Oh, not hospital.

20
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:59,709
<i>This episode of </i>Bluey
<i>is called </i>Hospital.

21
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:02,291
Please lie here.

22
00:01:02,375 --> 00:01:03,458
Thanks, Doctor.

23
00:01:03,542 --> 00:01:04,959
No, I'm the nurse.

24
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:06,375
Oh, sorry. Thanks, nurse.

25
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:08,041
My name is Telemachus.

26
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:10,125
This remote control makes the bed

27
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:11,875
go up and down, Telemachus.

28
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:13,083
Oh, great.

29
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:14,959
This will make the legs go up.

30
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:16,667
-Boop pzhhh!
-Aah!

31
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,709
Oops. Wrong button. Sorry, dear.

32
00:01:18,792 --> 00:01:20,041
-Boop pzhh!
-Ohh!

33
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:21,542
-Pzhhh!
-Aah!

34
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:23,333
-Pzhhh!
-Whoa!

35
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:24,750
Now, don't worry.

36
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:26,834
We're gonna make you feel all better.

37
00:01:26,917 --> 00:01:27,959
Oh, good.

38
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:30,166
I'm actually a bit nervous at hospitals.

39
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:32,291
There's no need to be nervous.

40
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:33,291
-Hello!
- Aah!

41
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:34,542
I'm the doctor.

42
00:01:34,625 --> 00:01:36,458
Oh, hello, Doctor. My name is --

43
00:01:36,542 --> 00:01:37,667
-Sting!
-Ouch!

44
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:39,709
Oh, brave boy.

45
00:01:39,792 --> 00:01:41,875
-What was that?!
-A needle.

46
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:43,208
Now, what seems to be the matter?

47
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:44,667
Why did you give me a needle

48
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,917
<i>before </i>asking me what's the matter?

49
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,834
Because I'm very busy.

50
00:01:48,917 --> 00:01:49,917
Now, what's up?

51
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,333
Well, my belly hurts.

52
00:01:52,417 --> 00:01:53,959
Have you got a baby in there?

53
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:55,500
No, I don't think so.

54
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:58,792
Nurse, do an X-ray
on the big blue guy, please.

55
00:01:58,875 --> 00:02:00,417
I think there's a baby in there.

56
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,458
Yes, Doctor.

57
00:02:01,542 --> 00:02:03,417
Hang on. I really don't think I have a --

58
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,667
-Sting!
-Ouch!

59
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,875
-Bye!
-Good grief!

60
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,792
She certainly likes those needles.

61
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:10,250
Don't worry, sweetie.

62
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:12,333
It's all to make you feel better.

63
00:02:12,417 --> 00:02:14,291
Now, time for your X-ray.

64
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:16,291
Ready? Three, two, one.

65
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:18,709
X-ray!

66
00:02:18,792 --> 00:02:21,458
X-ray will be ready in a jiffy!

67
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:22,834
Oh, good.

68
00:02:22,917 --> 00:02:24,792
I'll just relax.

69
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,917
-I'm back! Sting!
-Oww!

70
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,333
Bluey-- I mean, Doctor--

71
00:02:29,417 --> 00:02:31,917
can that be the last injection, please?

72
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,083
Nope.

73
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:34,625
Here's the X-ray, Doctor.

74
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:35,875
Oh, thank you.

75
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:37,250
I'll just get this plaster off.

76
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:38,250
-Huh?
-Rip!

77
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:39,250
Oww!

78
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:40,667
Brave boy.

79
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,291
Oh, well, this does not look good.

80
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:44,792
You see just here?

81
00:02:44,917 --> 00:02:47,709
Oh, look. It's a... possum?

82
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:50,125
Yes. You have a possum in your belly.

83
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:52,625
That's not a possum. It's a cat!

84
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:54,667
Oh, yes, you have a cat in your belly.

85
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,291
How did it get in there?

86
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:58,834
-Did you eat one?
-No!

87
00:02:58,917 --> 00:03:02,417
Well, no one really knows
how cats get in your belly,

88
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,000
but probably through your bellybutton.

89
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:06,375
What?! Really?

90
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:07,417
Yeah.

91
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,709
Probably, they just set up
a slide while you're asleep

92
00:03:10,792 --> 00:03:12,917
and just slide right in, you know?

93
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,041
My goodness.

94
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:15,375
We'll have to operate.

95
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:17,291
-Yes, Doctor!
-Whoa. Hang on.

96
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:18,709
Let's do this!

97
00:03:18,792 --> 00:03:20,375
-Here's a magazine to read.
-Oh!

98
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:23,083
You mean you're not even
gonna put me to sleep first?

99
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:24,834
Oh, yeah, I guess we could.

100
00:03:24,917 --> 00:03:27,917
Nurse, can you put this
big blue guy to sleep, please?

101
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,083
Yes, Doctor.

Oh, good. I can give him another needle.

Sting!

108
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,166
Oww! Bluey!

109
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,583
You're meant to be asleep!

110
00:03:43,667 --> 00:03:45,834
No... more... needles!

111
00:03:45,917 --> 00:03:46,917

Ah ha ha! Aroooo!

118

-Oh, I think I got it!

Aah!

122
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,041
Aah! That's not a cat!

123
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:09,125
That's an octopus!

124
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,458
Put him back in!

125
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:12,709
I think it's supposed to be in there!

126
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,959
-Get back in, octopus!

127
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:18,375
So many tentacles!

128
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:19,583
Doctor, catch!

129
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:21,417
-Get... back...i n!

130
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,500
Ohh!

131
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,458
Aah! Bingo!

132
00:04:24,542 --> 00:04:25,875
It's got the remote!

133
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:28,166
-Let go!
-Whoaaa!

134
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,875
Hey!

135
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:31,417
Let go!

136
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,875
Hey! I see the cat!

137
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:34,208
I see the cat!

138
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,250
Nurse, give me something to whack it with.

139
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:37,250
Okay.

140
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,208
-Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

141
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:41,834
Ooh! Ooh!

142
00:04:41,917 --> 00:04:43,000
Ooh, I got his tail!

143
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,041
Pull it!

144
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,417
-Aaaaah!

145
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,458
What happened?

146
00:04:47,542 --> 00:04:48,583
It bit me!

147
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:50,291
Oh, you poor dear.

148
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,291
That cat's not going anywhere!

149
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,417
Oh, my!

150
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,667
Better wake the big blue guy and tell him.

151
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:59,000
You mean we can't make him
feel all better?

152
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:00,125
Nope. Wake up, mate!

153
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:02,125
-Oww! Bluey!

154
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:03,709
<i>Doctor </i>Bluey.

155
00:05:03,792 --> 00:05:05,125
Is the operation finished?

156
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,834
Yeah, sorry. There's nothing we can do.

157
00:05:07,917 --> 00:05:09,583
That cat just won't come out.

158
00:05:09,667 --> 00:05:11,583
Oh. I see.

159
00:05:11,667 --> 00:05:13,542
Now, I've got other patients.

160
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:14,583
You're on your own.

161
00:05:14,667 --> 00:05:15,500
What?!

162
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:16,917
See ya!

163
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:20,500
Aww. I thought I was
gonna feel all better.

164
00:05:21,834 --> 00:05:23,166
I'm sorry.

165
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,875
That's okay. You tried your best.

166
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:28,959
Hmm.

167
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:30,709
Leave it with me.

168
00:05:30,792 --> 00:05:32,333
Okay, nurse.

169
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,166
Hmm. Yes.

170
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:38,000
Those prickles will
have to come out, I'm afraid.

171
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:39,583
Excuse me, Doctor.

172
00:05:39,667 --> 00:05:41,166
I'm very busy, nurse.

173
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,542
I know, but can you look
at this X-ray again?

174
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:46,458
If it's from the big blue guy,

175
00:05:46,542 --> 00:05:48,625
there's really nothing I can do.

176
00:05:48,709 --> 00:05:50,750
Just check it a bit closer.

177
00:05:50,834 --> 00:05:52,417
Fine!

178
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,875
Wait a minute!

179
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:58,041
I didn't see <i>this </i>before.

180
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:01,625
Hello, big blue guy.

181
00:06:01,709 --> 00:06:03,375
His name's Telemachus.

182
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:06,583
Something else has turned up
on your X-ray, Telemachus.

183
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:08,500
-Really?
-Look-- here.

184
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:09,792
Oh.

185
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:11,792
It's a... pot plant?

186
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,709
No! It's a mouse!

187
00:06:13,792 --> 00:06:15,625
Ah. Of course-- a mouse.

188
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,750
I think you swallowed a mouse!

189
00:06:17,834 --> 00:06:20,291
And then the cat ran in after it.

190
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:22,250
Because cats chase mice!

191
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:23,333
Oh, goodness!

192
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:24,583
What are you gonna do?

193
00:06:24,667 --> 00:06:25,917
Hmmmmm.

194
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,375
What if we lured the mouse out...

195
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:30,000
With some cheese?

196
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:31,834
Then the cat would chase the mouse...

197
00:06:31,917 --> 00:06:33,542
Right out of my belly!

198
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:34,667
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

199
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:37,583
Little bit lower!

200
00:06:37,667 --> 00:06:39,625
Little bit lower!

201
00:06:39,709 --> 00:06:40,834
There's the mouse!

202
00:06:40,917 --> 00:06:41,959
Rowr!

203
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:43,125
And there's the cat!

204
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:44,417
-Hooray!
-Hooray!

205
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,041
Oh, good kitty.

206
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:47,208
How do you feel?

207
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:48,208
Hmm.

208
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:49,917
I feel all better!

209
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,291
-Hooray!
-Hooray!

210
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:52,542
Thanks, Doctor.

211
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:54,208
And thank <i>you, </i>nurse.

212
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:56,125
You're welcome.

213
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:59,709
Well, if that's that,
then I guess I'll be on my way.

214
00:06:59,792 --> 00:07:01,250
-Oh, one more thing.
-What's that?

215
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:02,208
Sting!
