1
00:00:06,083 --> 00:00:07,041
Mum!

2
00:00:11,917 --> 00:00:12,917
Dad!

3
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:18,667
Bingo!

4
00:00:22,834 --> 00:00:25,959
- Bluey!

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,542
Shhh!

6
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:31,959
Bandit, I'm just having
a quick shower,

7
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:33,542
then I'll give you
a hand cleaning the room.

8
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:35,750
All good, I got it covered.

9
00:00:35,834 --> 00:00:38,709
-Now, where are those naughty kids?

10
00:00:39,959 --> 00:00:40,834
- Yeah!
-Yahh!

11
00:00:40,917 --> 00:00:42,542
Oh, whoa, here they are.

12
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:43,667
Do that again!

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,959
Kids, no kids.

14
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:49,000
Kids, no kids.

15
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:50,375
Kids, no kids.

16
00:00:51,792 --> 00:00:53,959
-Let's play Hotels!
-Yeah!

17
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:56,750
Oh, no, not Hotels.

18
00:00:56,834 --> 00:01:00,250
<i>This episode of </i>Bluey
<i>is called </i>Hotel.

19
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:12,667
Oh, Bingo,
we have a guest.

20
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,875
I want to be
a crazy pillow!

21
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:17,458
No, you're
the crazy hotel helper.

22
00:01:17,542 --> 00:01:19,750
-Aww.
-Hello.

23
00:01:19,834 --> 00:01:21,250
No, Dad, you have
to push the bell.

24
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:23,166
Oh, okay.

25
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,125
-Diiiing!
-Aaah!

26
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:27,959
I might just fix
that bell's volume.

27
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:31,166
There.
Let's try again.

28
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,083
-Ding!
-That's better.

29
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:34,333
Hello, how are you?

30
00:01:34,417 --> 00:01:36,875
-We are very nice.
-I'm good.

31
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:39,083
I'd like a room,
please.

32
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:40,875
Oh, yes,
we have some rooms.

33
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:42,417
One with a TV.

34
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,625
Oh, yes, sure.

35
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:44,917
This way, please.

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,542
Thank you!

37
00:01:46,625 --> 00:01:48,041
Bingo, grab his suitcase.

38
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:50,458
No, my name is Slobberdobba.

39
00:01:50,542 --> 00:01:53,375
Oh, yes, grab his suitcase,
Slobberdobba.

40
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:56,959
I have an important cleaning job
to do in the morning,

41
00:01:57,041 --> 00:02:01,333
so it's very important
that I am not disturbed.

42
00:02:01,417 --> 00:02:02,834
Oh, of course.

43
00:02:02,917 --> 00:02:05,417
We have this lovely room.

44
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,500
It has the sleepy bunny
night-light

45
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:08,583
and some toys.

46
00:02:08,667 --> 00:02:11,250
Hmm, no thanks.

47
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:14,083
We also have this room.

48
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:17,709
Hmm, maybe too many computers
and not enough beds.

49
00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:21,000
And we have this room.

50
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:23,250
Hey!
Do you mind?

51
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:26,375
-Oh, no, too stinky.

52
00:02:27,917 --> 00:02:30,000
And this is the big room.

53
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,709
It has a bed and a TV.

54
00:02:32,792 --> 00:02:34,959
Oh, and there's a lady in the shower.

55
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:35,875
Is that okay?

56
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:37,959
This will do nicely.

57
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:40,291
Goodnight!

58
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:42,959
Hmm, this pillow
isn't very comfy.

59
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:44,917
-Yes, it is.
-Oh, okay.

60
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:48,792
-Yarp! Yarp! Yarp!

61
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:50,875
Crazy helper!

62
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,834
Okay, see you
in the morning, sir.

63
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,333
Yes, please see that I am
not disturbed until then.

64
00:02:56,417 --> 00:02:58,000
Oh, of course.

65
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:00,250
My helper won't be crazy at all.

66
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:02,083
Oh, I'm sure she won't.

67
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:04,709
Yaaaarp!

68
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:13,083
Me tidy room now!

69
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:16,041
-What?
-Yarp yarp yarp yaaarp!

70
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:18,125
-Oh, Slobberdobba!
-Yarp yarp yarp yarp!

71
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:20,458
-I'm terribly sorry about this, sir.
-Yarp yarp yaaarp! Yaaarp!

72
00:03:20,542 --> 00:03:22,709
-Yarp yarp yarp! Yarp yarp yarp!
-Well, I should say so.

73
00:03:22,792 --> 00:03:24,667
I have a very important meeting
in the morning.

74
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,875
Yarp yarp yarp yarp yarp!

75
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:27,542
Do you need a crazy pillow?

76
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,500
No, he doesn't.

77
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,250
-Yarp yarp yarp yarp yaaaarp!
-This is very embarrassing.

78
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:32,625
It won't happen again.

79
00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:35,709
Well, please see that it doesn't.

80
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:38,917
-Breakfast time!
- Huh? Wha--What?

81
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,709
Breakfast time!

82
00:03:40,792 --> 00:03:42,041
Who wants bacon?

83
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:44,041
But it's the middle
of the night!

84
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:47,625
Who wants
night bacon?

85
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:49,083
Slobberdobba!

86
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:51,041
I'm so sorry, sir.

87
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:52,500
This won't happen again.

88
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:54,000
Shapoorr!

89
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:57,875
Well, night bacon does sound
pretty good, actually.

90
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:00,917
As long as I'm up,
I might as well watch the news.

91
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,792
Yeah, the news!

92
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:05,959
Bluey, can I be crazy pillow now?

93
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,125
Come on, Bingo.

94
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:09,083
Ugh!

95
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,000
Try the TV again!

96
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:12,917
Okay.
Click!

97
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,667
Oh, hello.

98
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:15,917
I am the TV.

99
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,709
Today on the news --

100
00:04:17,792 --> 00:04:21,583
A wild storm kept banging
people's heads into the bed!

101
00:04:21,667 --> 00:04:24,834
-Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

102
00:04:24,917 --> 00:04:27,208
-Cartoons are on!

103
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:29,917
Now, back to the news.

104
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,667
We have thunder!

105
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:35,333
-Oooh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

106
00:04:35,417 --> 00:04:39,000
Oh-oh-oh!
Oh! Oh! Oh! Ohh!

107
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:42,417
Bluey, I want to be
a crazy pillow.

108
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,959
No, you're the news.

109
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:45,834
-Arghh!
-And lightning!

110
00:04:45,917 --> 00:04:47,125
Brrrr-pow!

111
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,333
No, I'm not playing.

112
00:04:49,417 --> 00:04:52,667
You're bossing me around.

113
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,959
Slobberdobba, come back this instant!

114
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:57,375
Ah, TV.

115
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:59,709
Always people
shouting at each other.

116
00:04:59,792 --> 00:05:01,166
Click!

117
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:04,000
Alright, kid, I gotta get back
to making the bed.

118
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:06,291
No, Dad, wait.
Don't stop.

119
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:07,834
You have to keep playing.

120
00:05:07,917 --> 00:05:09,792
We've not finished Hotels.

121
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:12,917
Well, you better sort it out
with Bingo, kiddo.

122
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You have to let her make
some decisions, too, you know.

123
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,375
Okay.

124
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:19,500
Don't start tidying.

125
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:22,917
Please, Bingo,
you have to keep playing

126
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,792
or Dad will stop playing.

127
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:27,125
I don't wanna play anymore.

128
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:28,750
Please?

129
00:05:28,834 --> 00:05:29,917
No!

130
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,333
Please!

131
00:05:31,417 --> 00:05:32,709
No!

132
00:05:32,792 --> 00:05:34,792
Please, Bingo,
I'll do anything.

133
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:37,041
No!

134
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:39,041
Okay.

135
00:05:40,792 --> 00:05:42,709
Alright, I'll play.

136
00:05:42,792 --> 00:05:44,500
-Really?
-Yeah!

137
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:47,125
But I wanna be
a crazy pillow.

138
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:48,125
Okay.

139
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:49,291
Yeah!

140
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:51,875
Crazy pillow!

141
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:53,250
Hello, sir.

142
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:55,709
I have a new pillow here for you.

143
00:05:55,792 --> 00:05:57,041
Oh, thank you.

144
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:58,959
Don't worry.
It's not a crazy pillow.

145
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:01,542
-Well, that's a plus.

146
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:04,875
My, oh, my,
this is very comfortable

147
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:06,875
and not wriggly at all.

148
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:09,125
Okay, well, I best
go to sleep now.

149
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:10,458
Night.

150
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:17,000
Agh! Tickly nose.

151
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,500
Hmm, that's odd.

152
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:23,834
Hey! Pillow!

153
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:25,125
-Get back here!

154
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:27,250
Now, stay there, pillow.

155
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:28,834
And where's
my blanket?

156
00:06:28,917 --> 00:06:30,542
-Ah, there it is!

157
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,667
Ah, that's better.

158
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,041
Tickle him!

159
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:38,667
Hey, wait a minute!

160
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,834
Hey, this is a crazy pillow!

161
00:06:41,917 --> 00:06:43,041
Yeah!

162
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:45,166
I'm a crazy blanket!

163
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:48,583
Aaah! Runaway bed stuff!

164
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:52,083
Stop!
I'll catch you with my net!

165
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm coming to get you!

166
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,458
Stop!

167
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:02,166
I thought you were gonna
<i>clean </i>the room.
