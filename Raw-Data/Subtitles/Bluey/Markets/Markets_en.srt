The Tooth Fairy came!

15
00:00:33,917 --> 00:00:35,750
Hey, nice one, Bluey!

16
00:00:35,834 --> 00:00:37,000
Way to go, kid.

17
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:38,417
She left me five bucks!

18
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,625
[sputters] Five bucks?

19
00:00:40,709 --> 00:00:41,792
Yeah, I know.

20
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,417
Five bucks!

21
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,208
Five bucks?

22
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:48,000
That's what she left
all Bluey's friends.

23
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:51,667
Well, that Tooth Fairy's
doing well for herself, isn't she?

24
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,000
Hey, maybe you can spend it
at the markets today.

25
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:55,792
Yeah!

28
00:01:02,709 --> 00:01:05,166
This little piggy
went to market,

29
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,959
and this little piggy stayed home.

30
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:09,625
Hey! No, I didn't.

31
00:01:09,709 --> 00:01:10,917
I'm coming, too!

32
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,667
Check this out, Bingo.

33
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,625
The Tooth Fairy even put
a special sticker on here.

Wow.

35
00:01:16,917 --> 00:01:18,208
What are you gonna
spend it on?

36
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:20,083
That's the question.

37
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:22,333
Hmm, that is a question.

38
00:01:22,417 --> 00:01:25,000
Hmm, question.

The Tooth Fairy
gave me five bucks!

45
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:41,208
Wow!

46
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:42,917
What are you gonna spend it on?

47
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,583
I don't know.

48
00:01:44,667 --> 00:01:45,834
Can you come and help me?

49
00:01:45,917 --> 00:01:47,125
Yeah!

50
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:48,792
Mum, can I go and help Bluey?

51
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:50,291
Sure thing, Indy.

52
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:51,917
I'll keep an eye on 'em.

53
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,333
Follow me!

54
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,208
Giant bubbles!

57
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,291
Do you wanna get one?

58
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:07,208
Yeah, I do.

59
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:08,959
Wait!

60
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:10,291
Pony ride!

61
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:11,542
Excuse me.

62
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:13,333
What's that pony's name?

63
00:02:13,417 --> 00:02:15,000
Her name's Biscuits.

64
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:16,250
-Aww!
-Aww!

65
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:18,375
And what's that one's name?

66
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,750
Buttermilk.

67
00:02:19,834 --> 00:02:21,959
-Aww!
-Aww!

68
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,959
[whispering] I really,
really want to ride Buttermilk.

69
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:27,542
Definitely Buttermilk.

70
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:29,333
Can we ride Buttermilk, please?

71
00:02:29,417 --> 00:02:30,583
Okay, honey.

72
00:02:30,667 --> 00:02:31,709
Up you get.

73
00:02:31,792 --> 00:02:33,166
[straining]

74
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,250
Okay, Indy, you can sit in front.

75
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:37,125
Oh, I'm sorry, honey,

76
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:40,041
but you don't have enough money
for two riders.

77
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:43,750
Oh. I only want to go
if Indy can come.

78
00:02:43,834 --> 00:02:45,625
It's okay, Bluey.

79
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:47,458
I'll wait here.

80
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:48,917
Hmm.

81
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:51,291
I think I've changed my mind.

82
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,709
Well, aren't you a good friend?

83
00:02:55,792 --> 00:02:58,166
Yes, Pony Lady.

84
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,208
Goodbye, Buttermilk.

85
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:01,291
You're so beautiful.

86
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,625
[all] German sausage!

87
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:05,750
German sausage!

88
00:03:05,834 --> 00:03:07,291
German sausage!

89
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:10,875
Okay, I want
a German sausage

90
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,333
and the squirty sauce,

91
00:03:12,417 --> 00:03:14,875
but only on one end,
so you can have the other end.

92
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,083
But I'm not allowed that.

93
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:17,625
Why not?

94
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:20,792
Mum says it's got added ingredients...?

95
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,625
Can you have barbecue sauce?

96
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:23,917
I'm not allowed that one either.

97
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,375
Mustard?

98
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:27,542
I'm definitely not allowed mustard.

99
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:30,041
Well, what are we
gonna get then?

100
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:32,667
[dog] Poffertjes! Poffertjes!

101
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,709
Indy!

102
00:03:33,792 --> 00:03:35,208
Poffertjes!

103
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:36,417
Poffertjes?

104
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,667
[both sniffing]

105
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,417
Have these got any
wheat, sugar,

106
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,792
gluten, or dairy
in them?

107
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:43,750
That's all they've got in them.

108
00:03:43,834 --> 00:03:44,875
-Ohhh!
-Aww!

109
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,792
My friend can't eat them.

110
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:48,041
Bye, girls.

111
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:49,458
Poffertjes!

112
00:03:49,542 --> 00:03:53,000
I just don't know what to get.

113
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:54,959
Anyone want the last toffee apple?

114
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:57,542
I've got one toffee apple left.

115
00:03:59,542 --> 00:04:01,417
Oh, oh.

116
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,750
I will!

117
00:04:02,834 --> 00:04:05,542
Lovely, jubbly.

118
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,291
Thank you.

119
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm pretty sure that has sugar in it.

120
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:18,500
[chomping]

121
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:23,375
Ah, toffee apple.

122
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:24,917
Old school.

123
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,709
I'm not sure I like
this toffee apple.

124
00:04:27,792 --> 00:04:29,875
Plus, Indy can't have any.

125
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:31,083
Oh, that's no good.

126
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:32,417
[singer] Thank you!

127
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,750

128
00:04:34,834 --> 00:04:36,333
[feedback] Ah, thanks buddy!

129
00:04:36,417 --> 00:04:37,875
Aaaaaah!

130
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:39,291
That deserves a song.

[upbeat music playing]

132
00:04:41,834 --> 00:04:44,709
Dad, I'm not sure
I made the right choice.

133
00:04:44,792 --> 00:04:47,333
I think I want to put my
five bucks in that case

134
00:04:47,417 --> 00:04:48,625
and get a song.

135
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:50,583
Oh, right.

136
00:04:50,667 --> 00:04:52,625
Can I get my five bucks back?

137
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,125
That's not really
how it works, kiddo.

138
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:56,917
Once you've spent money, it's...

139
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,709
well, gone.

140
00:04:58,792 --> 00:04:59,792
Oh.

141
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:01,333
Okay.

142
00:05:01,417 --> 00:05:03,083
Don't worry, Bluey.

143
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:04,959
My mum always says to me,

144
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:07,667
"What goes around
comes around."

145
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,542
What does that mean?

146
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:10,875
I don't know.

147
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:12,709
Sweetheart, can you
go get your Dad

148
00:05:12,792 --> 00:05:14,375
a German sausage, please?

149
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:15,875
Okay, Dad.

Now, that's a tune.

154
00:05:24,542 --> 00:05:26,125
One sausage, please!

155
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:28,750
Thanks.
There you go.

156
00:05:28,834 --> 00:05:30,041
Thanks!

157
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,709
Gruber, go get me a carrot juice.

158
00:05:31,792 --> 00:05:33,000
Sure thing, Dad.

159
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,208
Carrot juice, please.

160
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:38,709
Oh, we're out of carrots.

161
00:05:38,792 --> 00:05:41,083
Will you get me a bag
of carrots please, Juniper?

162
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:42,583
Yes, Mum.

163
00:05:42,667 --> 00:05:45,291
I'd like these carrots, please.

164
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,542
Just these, please.

165
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:56,709
I'll have that one, thank you.

166
00:06:00,667 --> 00:06:02,333
Indy?

167
00:06:02,417 --> 00:06:03,333
Yes, Mum?

168
00:06:03,417 --> 00:06:04,792
Be a sweetie.

169
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:07,250
Go and pop this in the guitar case for me.

170
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:08,500
Okay!

Whoa!
Five bucks?

Thanks, matey!

176
00:06:20,542 --> 00:06:21,917
That deserves another song.
