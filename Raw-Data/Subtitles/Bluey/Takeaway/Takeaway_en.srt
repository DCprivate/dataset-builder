1
00:00:06,291 --> 00:00:07,208
Mum!

2
00:00:12,083 --> 00:00:13,000
Dad!

3
00:00:17,834 --> 00:00:18,750
Bingo!

4
00:00:22,917 --> 00:00:26,041
- Bluey!

5
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:34,291
<i>This episode of </i>Bluey
<i>is called </i>Takeaway.

6
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:37,875
Ooh, can I have a shower
under that tap?

7
00:00:37,959 --> 00:00:39,792
No wet dogs in car.

8
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:41,834
-Aww!
-Dad?

9
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:42,917
Yeah, mate?

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,709
Where do rocks come from?

11
00:00:44,792 --> 00:00:45,917
Uhhh...

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,500
Can we have some
of your takeaway, too?

13
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:50,792
-Yeah!
-You girls don't like spicy.

14
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:52,583
Ooh, <i>I </i>like spicy.

15
00:00:52,667 --> 00:00:55,083
You squirts wait here.
I'll be two seconds.

16
00:00:56,834 --> 00:00:58,083
-Raaah!

17
00:01:06,917 --> 00:01:08,750
Alright!
Let's boogie.

18
00:01:08,834 --> 00:01:10,208
-Yeah!
-Yes, boogie.

19
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:12,208
Hang about!

20
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:13,583
Stay.

21
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:15,917
Aaah!

22
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:20,792
Pbbt!

23
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:22,083
Pbbt!

24
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,250
Five more minutes, kids.

25
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:26,834
They forgot the spring rolls!

26
00:01:28,834 --> 00:01:30,250
<i>Hey, babe. What's up?</i>

27
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:32,166
They forgot
the spring rolls!

28
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,333
<i>Oh! Your Dad</i>
<i>and spring rolls!</i>

29
00:01:35,417 --> 00:01:37,000
They're just cooking 'em now.

30
00:01:37,083 --> 00:01:39,709
<i>Forget 'em, babe.</i>
<i>The kids must be starving.</i>

31
00:01:39,792 --> 00:01:42,542
Not...leaving...
without...spring rolls.

32
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:43,917
Say "See ya, Mum."

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,375
See ya, Mum!

34
00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:47,208
<i>-Well, good luck.</i>

35
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:49,250
Leave without
the spring rolls?

36
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:50,709
Is she crazy?

37
00:01:51,917 --> 00:01:53,875
How long is five minutes?

38
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:56,917
Uh, it's one episode
of "Chutney Chimp."

39
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:58,750
What are we
gonna play?

40
00:01:58,834 --> 00:02:01,917
We're gonna play
Dad Reads The Newspaper.

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,625
Ooh, can I buy a juice?

42
00:02:03,709 --> 00:02:05,750
What do these words say?

43
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,291
No idea, kiddo.

44
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:09,792
And no. There's a tap over there
if you're thirsty.

45
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:14,375
Please, can I have
a shower in it?

46
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:15,834
Don't even think about it.

47
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,959
Dad, can you help me?

48
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:27,000
Do you need a drink, too, Bingo?

49
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:29,834
No, I'm not thirsty.

50
00:02:29,917 --> 00:02:31,417
Can I eat these plants?

51
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,834
No, mate.

52
00:02:33,917 --> 00:02:36,083
- Aah! Ohh!

53
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:38,500
Which way do you turn it off?

54
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:42,792
Why are some plants food,
like lettuce,

55
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:45,291
but other plants
<i>aren't </i>food?

56
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:47,041
Uh, well --

57
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:50,291
Dad, can I play with these?

58
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:53,000
Uh, just two, kid.
The shop guys need 'em.

59
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:54,083
How about three?

60
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:55,500
Two.

61
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:57,583
Dad, I'm thirsty.

62
00:02:57,667 --> 00:02:58,792
But I just --

63
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:00,542
Oh, never mind.

64
00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:04,000
Aah!

65
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,750
Aww!

66
00:03:05,834 --> 00:03:08,250
Quickly --grab two more,
but hang on to them.

67
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:17,000
Ohhh, I'm starving.

68
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:18,959
Can I have some takeaway?

69
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:21,083
Of course you can, customer.

70
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:23,667
Welcome to my takeaway restaurant.

71
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,166
Please, do sit down.

72
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,000
Up! Sst! Sst! Sst!
Get off!

73
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:28,417
Oh, thank you.

74
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,166
Here are some menus, Bingo.

75
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,667
You can have two,
in case you want <i>lots </i>of food.

76
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,166
My name isn't Bingo.

77
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,625
It's, uh...

78
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:41,291
...Tap Girl.

79
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:43,667
Can I have this, Dad?

80
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,834
I need to write
Tap Girl's order down.

81
00:03:45,917 --> 00:03:47,250
So, Ma'am,
what would you like?

82
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,208
I'm just gonna check
on the spring rolls.

83
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:52,250
I'll have some
super-spicy, please.

84
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:55,250
Certainly.
I'll just get that now.

85
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:56,542
Yechh! Wet menu!

86
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:58,041
Blegh!

87
00:03:58,125 --> 00:03:59,792
-Ooh!
-Me, me!

88
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:03,750
Uh, Tap Girl, I'm not sure
you can eat it for real life.

89
00:04:03,834 --> 00:04:05,417
But I'm hungry.

90
00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:07,917
Aah! Oh! Aah!
Aah! Aah!

91
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,542
Too spicy!

92
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,667
Ah, they're not ready yet.

93
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,500
Hey! My dinner!

94
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:14,625
Aaah!

95
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:16,125
Too spicy!

96
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:18,417
Okay, okay,
come here, mate.

97
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:21,917
How's that, kiddo?

98
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,250
Good.

99
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:25,834
But I need to do a wee.
I'm busting.

100
00:04:25,917 --> 00:04:26,792
Oh, man!

101
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,500
Okay. Umm...

102
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:30,208
I'm a walrus.

103
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:31,500
-Excuse me --

104
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:33,291
Bluey, don't even
think about it!

105
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:35,792
Where's the nearest toilet?

106
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,458
Oh, that's too far!

107
00:04:37,542 --> 00:04:39,458
Bingo, can you hold on till we get home?

108
00:04:39,542 --> 00:04:40,834
I'm busting!

109
00:04:40,917 --> 00:04:42,417
Okay, okay.

110
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,291
It's a bush wee.

111
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:46,750
-Dad?
-Yeah, mate?

112
00:04:46,834 --> 00:04:49,542
Is everything in the whole world
made of atoms?

113
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:51,709
Uh, yeah, I think so.

114
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:54,041
Aaah!
I can't turn it off!

115
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:56,750
-Bluey!
-I only meant to turn it on a little bit!

116
00:04:56,834 --> 00:04:59,375
Don't even think
about getting under that!

117
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,375
There's water everywhere!

118
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:02,959
Bingo, are you almost finished?

119
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:05,792
Not yet.
It's a long one.

120
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:09,959
-Get out of it!
-No, Mr Crow!

121
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:11,834
It's too spicy for you!

122
00:05:11,917 --> 00:05:14,959
What will happen
if we can never turn it off?!

123
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:16,583
Get outta here!

124
00:05:16,667 --> 00:05:18,959
The water will be up to the clouds!

125
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:20,792
Are you finished yet, Bingo?

126
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:22,625
Almost!

127
00:05:22,709 --> 00:05:23,875
Arghhh!

128
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:27,041
This is a really long wee, Bingo!

129
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:29,041
Finished!

130
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:31,166
Get outta here!

131
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,250
Yeah!

132
00:05:41,834 --> 00:05:42,959
Dad?

133
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:44,125
Yes, mate?

134
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:49,709
If grown-ups grow from babies
and only grown-ups <i>have </i>babies,

135
00:05:49,792 --> 00:05:51,709
who had the <i>first </i>baby?

136
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:55,834
Okay, forget
the spring rolls.

137
00:05:55,917 --> 00:05:57,625
Let's just get out of here.

138
00:05:57,709 --> 00:05:59,041
Whoa! Ooh!

139
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:05,875
Sorry. Your spring rolls
will be five more minutes.

140
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:07,250
What?

141
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,709
That's a whole other
"Chutney Chimp."

142
00:06:09,792 --> 00:06:11,291
Sorry about the wait.

143
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:13,375
Would you kids like
some fortune cookies?

144
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:14,458
Thank you.

145
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:16,375
What's happened out here?

146
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:19,667
They're biscuits.

147
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,041
With a little paper inside.

148
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:23,792
And writing on the paper.

149
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:25,250
What does it say?

150
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:28,750
It says
"Flowers may bloom again,

151
00:06:28,834 --> 00:06:32,500
but a person never has
the chance to be young again."

152
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,125
What does that mean?

153
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:37,667
It means...

154
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:41,583
...it's shower time!

155
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:43,000
For real life?

156
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:45,417
For real life.

157
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:51,458
Spring rolls are ready!

158
00:06:51,542 --> 00:06:54,041
Oh, great.
Just pop 'em on the table.

159
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:55,041
Thanks.

160
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:56,750
No worries.

161
00:06:56,834 --> 00:06:58,792
Oh, that looks fun.
