1
00:00:06,041 --> 00:00:06,959
Mum!

2
00:00:11,834 --> 00:00:12,875
Dad!

3
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:18,667
Bingo!

4
00:00:22,834 --> 00:00:25,959
- Bluey!

5
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:32,125
Today, Polly, the cousins
are coming over.

6
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:34,750
Mum and Aunt Trixie
are gonna play hockey.

7
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:38,125
That means we can play horsey
with Dad and Uncle Stripe.

8
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:40,125
Is that gonna be fun?

9
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:41,959
Yeah, I think so.

10
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:43,917
Ohh, good Polly Puppy.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,333
- Bluey!

12
00:00:45,417 --> 00:00:46,625
They're here!

13
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:52,917
Bluey, last time
the cousins visited,

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,208
you got upset because they
spilled passion fruit

15
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:56,959
all over Polly Puppy.

16
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:59,125
Oh, yeah,
I better put her away.

17
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:01,166
'Cause she's
your special puppy.

18
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,083
Yes! I'll put her in my room.

19
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:06,583
Oh, there's my watermelon!

20
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:07,792
Aah!

21
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:09,333
Nom nom nom nom!

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,500
Gidday, Bingo.
Gidday, Bluey.

23
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:13,500
Hello, Bandit.

24
00:01:13,583 --> 00:01:14,792
-Hi.
-Hi.

25
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:16,000
Hey kids, how're ya goin'?

26
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:17,291
-Hey, brother.
-Hey.

27
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:20,333
Ooh, show Aunt Chilli
your thongs, Muffin.

28
00:01:20,417 --> 00:01:23,166
Aunt Chilli,
I'm wearing thongs!

29
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,000
Oh, great!

30
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:25,959
Hello, Socks.

31
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:26,959
-Ooh!

32
00:01:27,041 --> 00:01:28,542
Arghhhh!

33
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:36,375
Okay kids, Aunt Trix and I
are off to play hockey.

34
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:38,959
Have fun with Dad
and Uncle Stripe.

35
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:39,875
See ya, kids.

36
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:41,333
Quick,
let's get out of here.

37
00:01:41,417 --> 00:01:42,250
-Bye!
-Bye!

38
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:43,959
See ya later!

39
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:45,166
All right, girls,

40
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,875
who wants
to sit on the couch

41
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:48,333
and watch cricket?!

42
00:01:48,417 --> 00:01:49,250
Noooo!

43
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:50,166
-Not me!
-Not me!

44
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,250
No way.

45
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:52,667
Let's play
horsey ride!

46
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,000
Yeah!

47
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:55,083
-Ahhh.

48
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:56,667
Well, we gave it
a shot.

49
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:00,041
<i>This episode of </i>Bluey
<i>is called </i>Horsey Ride.

50
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,041
Giddyup, Sparkles!

51
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,125
Neigh!

52
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,542
Giddyup,
Gallahop!

53
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:09,792
-Neigh! Prrrrt!

54
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:11,083
-Neigh!
-Brrrr!

55
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:14,375
Come on, horsies.
Giddyup!

56
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:15,750
-Brrr!
-Brrr!

57
00:02:15,834 --> 00:02:19,041
When I do this,
it means giddyup!

58
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:21,166
-Giddyup!
-Giddyup!

59
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,291
-Oh! Ahh!
-Ahh! Ohh!

60
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:24,375
-Brrr!
-Brrr!

61
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:26,709
Horsies love tiles.

62
00:02:26,792 --> 00:02:30,208
Sparkles needs
more sparkles on her.

63
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:31,917
Ooh, I'll get
some glitter.

64
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,625
-Neigh!
-Brrrr!

65
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:38,875
Aaaah!
Polly Puppy!

66
00:02:40,417 --> 00:02:41,333
Brrr!

67
00:02:41,417 --> 00:02:43,125
Daaaad!

68
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:44,500
-Let go, Socks!

69
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:48,500
Hey, hey. Okay,
chill the beans, everyone.

70
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:51,792
Socks won't let go
of Polly Puppy!

71
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:54,500
Socks, let Polly go.

72
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:58,000
It's Bluey's special toy.

73
00:02:58,083 --> 00:02:59,208
Let me try.

74
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:02,250
Hey there, Rocksocks,
how about we --

75
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:03,333
-Ow!

76
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:05,083
Well, I'm out of ideas.

77
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:11,083
I put all my special toys away
when my cousins come over.

78
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:12,959
You should have done that, Bluey.

79
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:15,208
Good idea, Muffin.

80
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:16,875
I was going to do that,

81
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,041
but then you ate me
like a watermelon,

82
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,709
and I got distracted.

83
00:03:21,792 --> 00:03:23,709
No point playing
the blame game.

84
00:03:23,792 --> 00:03:25,208
We need a solution.

85
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:29,125
Something for Socks that's
even more fun than Polly Puppy.

86
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,917
What about
a horsey ride?

87
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,500
Or two horsey rides?

88
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:35,875
What if we had a horsey wedding?

89
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:37,083
Yee!

90
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:38,875
Sparkles can marry Gallahop!

91
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,000
Huh?

92
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:41,625
And we could make confetti.

93
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:44,125
-What?
-And invite Socks!

94
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:45,667
-What was that?
-Yeah!

95
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:49,959
Oh, man.

96
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,083
-Socks!

97
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:57,500
We'd like to invite you

98
00:03:57,583 --> 00:04:00,000
to the wedding
of Sparkles and Gallahop!

99
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:02,417
-Huh?

100
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:06,291
Hmm.
Bring out Sparkles!

101
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:08,667
[Mendelssohn's
"Wedding March" plays]

102
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:14,792
I'm the luckiest horse
in the world.

103
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:17,041
Horsies can't talk.

104
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:19,917
Ladies and gentlemen,

105
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,875
may Sparkles marry
Gallahop today.

106
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,625
Socks! The wedding
has started!

107
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,709
It's not working.

108
00:04:32,792 --> 00:04:34,625
-Get them to say some things.

109
00:04:34,709 --> 00:04:37,625
You may now
say some things.

110
00:04:37,709 --> 00:04:38,834
Uh...

111
00:04:38,917 --> 00:04:40,750
I'm not marrying him.
He stinks.

112
00:04:42,917 --> 00:04:44,500
My heart is breaking.

113
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:47,917
I said, horsies can't talk!

114
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,291
Oh, I mean...

115
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,417
Let them get married!

116
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,083
You may now get married.

117
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:56,208
Neigh!

118
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:02,041
She said, you now get married!

119
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:04,625
You have to say "I do."

120
00:05:04,709 --> 00:05:07,375
Yeah, but in horsey talk.

121
00:05:11,792 --> 00:05:12,750
Brrr!

122
00:05:12,834 --> 00:05:14,291
-Neighhh!

123
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:15,959
Sparkles!

124
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:17,166
No!

125
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,208
Come back,
Sparkles!

126
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:22,500
You have to do it properly!

127
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:24,875
Neigh! Ooh!

128
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:26,625
-Brrr! Brrrr!

129
00:05:26,709 --> 00:05:28,208
Come back, Sparkles!

130
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:30,000
Marry Gallahop!

131
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:31,000
Now!

132
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:33,250
Brrr!

133
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,583
I want Polly back.

134
00:05:35,667 --> 00:05:37,208
Prrrrt!

135
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:42,375
Where'd he go?

136
00:05:45,709 --> 00:05:47,458
He's watching the cricket!

137
00:05:47,542 --> 00:05:48,667
Get him!

138
00:05:49,834 --> 00:05:51,917
Brrr! Brrr!

139
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,250
Neighhhh!

140
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:57,625
Neigh! Neigh!

141
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,250
Yeah!

142
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,250
Good one, Socks!

143
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,542
Aroooo!

144
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,917
I'd been
looking forward to this day

145
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,250
all my life,

146
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:19,917
and now it's ruined.

147
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:29,750
Neigh.

148
00:06:29,834 --> 00:06:31,041
Prrrrt.

149
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:34,792
You may now say "I do."

150
00:06:39,542 --> 00:06:41,500
Well, I guess that's why
we wear mouth guards.

151
00:06:42,834 --> 00:06:45,125
Well, that sounds positive.

152
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,917
What have you kids
been up to?

153
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,291
Ah, you know, just regular
childhood games.

154
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:54,792
Uncle Stripe married Dad!

155
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:55,875
Yeah!

156
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:57,583
Oh, really?

157
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:58,709
-Arooooo!

158
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:01,625
Well, who could blame him?
