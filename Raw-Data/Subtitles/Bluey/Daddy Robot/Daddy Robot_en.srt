1
00:00:06,166 --> 00:00:07,125
Mum!

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,166
Dad!

3
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:18,667
Bingo!

4
00:00:22,834 --> 00:00:24,917
- Bluey!

5
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:29,917
All right, kids, time to tidy up.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,542
-Ohh, Mum!
-Ohh, Mum!

7
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:33,917
We don't like tidying.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,125
There's no way around it, I'm afraid.

9
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:37,542
-Ohhh!
-Ohhh!

10
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,959
Hey, Bingo, let's get
Daddy Robot to do it.

11
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:43,417
Yeah!

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,542
<i>This episode of </i>Bluey
<i>is called </i>Daddy Robot.

13
00:00:49,417 --> 00:00:52,000
Hey, Daddy Robot!

14
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:53,792
Oh, uh...

15
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:55,625
Yes, Master. Brrt brrp.

16
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:59,417
We need you to do something.

17
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,417
Come with us to the playroom.

18
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,250
Brrt brrp. Yes, Master.

19
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,625
-Zzzt! Zzzt! Zzzt...
-Wait.

20
00:01:05,709 --> 00:01:08,667
Actually, <i>carry </i>us to the playroom.

21
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:09,959
Yes, Master.

22
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:11,834
Anh! Ooh! Anh! Ooh!

23
00:01:11,917 --> 00:01:14,125
We have to robo-boogie there.

24
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:15,959
Brrp! Yes, Master.

25
00:01:22,667 --> 00:01:26,959
Daddy Robot, we order you
to tidy up the playroom.

26
00:01:27,041 --> 00:01:30,458
Brrt brrp! To serve my masters
is the highest honor.

27
00:01:30,542 --> 00:01:32,917
It's working!

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,333
Ahh!

29
00:01:34,417 --> 00:01:37,000
Ahh! So relaxing.

30
00:01:37,083 --> 00:01:39,750
Yeah, this is how we should <i>always </i>do it.

31
00:01:39,834 --> 00:01:40,667
Yeah.

32
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,750
Actually, Daddy Robot,

33
00:01:42,834 --> 00:01:46,417
we never want to tidy
the playroom ever again.

34
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,333
Yeah, ever again.

35
00:01:48,417 --> 00:01:49,834
Never again?

36
00:01:49,917 --> 00:01:51,250
Never again.

37
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:53,291
Ever. At all.

38
00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:54,333
You understand?

39
00:01:54,417 --> 00:01:56,083
Yes, Master. Brrrt boop boop.

40
00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:57,834
Recalculating objectives.

41
00:01:57,917 --> 00:01:59,250
Brrrt boop boop boop.

42
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:02,583
Aah! What are you doing,
Daddy Robot?

43
00:02:02,667 --> 00:02:04,375
Following Master's orders. Brrrt brrrp.

44
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,750
Aah! Put us down!

45
00:02:06,834 --> 00:02:09,667
I love Daddy Robot.

46
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,667
Where are you taking us?!

47
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,125
Brrrp. To the wheelie bin.

48
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:14,875
What?! Why?!

49
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,208
You two are the reason
playroom is always untidy.

50
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:22,625
If I throw you in wheelie bin,
playroom will always be tidy,

51
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:26,208
and then you will never have to
tidy playroom ever again.

52
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:27,166
-What?!
-What?!

53
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,333
It's a solid plan, Master.

54
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:31,375
Mum!

55
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,875
Daddy Robot is gonna
throw us in the wheelie bin!

56
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:35,917
Oh, no!

57
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Quick, Mum, we need the sprayer!

58
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:39,458
-Catch!
-Brrrt brrrp boop.

59
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,583
Ooh-ahh-eee-eee-ahh-ooh! Brrrrr!

60
00:02:42,667 --> 00:02:44,458
Syntax error! Zz zz!

61
00:02:44,542 --> 00:02:47,125
Please press "Play" on tape. Brrt brrt.

62
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,625
He's malfunctioning!

63
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,917
Bee brrrp eee!

64
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,125
Why was Daddy Robot
throwing you in the wheelie bin?

65
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:56,208
Oh. Um, well...

66
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:58,667
Must tidy up. Bee brrp brrp.

67
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,125
Come here, vacuum cleaner.

68
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:01,333
Aah!

69
00:03:01,417 --> 00:03:03,166
-I'm not a vacuum cleaner!

70
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,542
Yeah, Daddy Robot,
she's not a vacuum cleaner.

71
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:08,750
Oh, yes. Brrt brrt. My mistake.

72
00:03:08,834 --> 00:03:10,667
This is not a vacuum cleaner.

73
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,083
I told you!

74
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:14,125
-It's a banjo!
-What?!

75
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:19,583
Hey, that's my sister, not a banjo!

76
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:22,375
Brrt brrp. What are you doing
out of the laundry basket?

77
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:24,208
Laundry basket?!

78
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:25,875
Yes. You <i>are </i>laundry.

79
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:27,709
I folded you this morning.

80
00:03:27,792 --> 00:03:29,875
-Come here.
-Aaaaaaah!

81
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:33,667
Fold, fold, fold, fold, fold!

82
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,333
I'm not laundry!

83
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:38,166
She's not laundry!

84
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,417
Oh, no. A Guinea pig has escaped.

85
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,417
What?!

86
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:42,667
Aah!

87
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,667
Mum! Daddy Robot thinks I'm a guinea pig!

88
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,667
What should I do?!

89
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,250
Ya! Ya! Ya! Ya!

90
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:49,875
Come back here, guinea pig.

91
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:52,125
You have to push his nose to turn him off!

92
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:53,667
But how?

93
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,625
I know! I've got an idea!

94
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,417
Brrbraa! Brrbraa! Brrbaa!

95
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,458
La la!

96
00:03:59,542 --> 00:04:01,417
Look, Daddy Robot.

97
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,458
Bzzt!

98
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:04,792
It's a Mummy Robot.

99
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:06,667
Brrrrt! Hello.

100
00:04:07,917 --> 00:04:09,625
Cheese and crackers.

101
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:12,709
You're the most beautiful robot
I've ever seen.

102
00:04:12,792 --> 00:04:15,709
Boop boop boop! You are too kind.

103
00:04:15,792 --> 00:04:17,709
My name is Daddy Robo--

104
00:04:17,792 --> 00:04:20,041
-Da-da-da-da-da-da-da! Brrrp.

105
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:25,250
That was a little odd.

106
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,917
Please pretend I didn't just do that.

107
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,542
It is hard to unsee something like that.

108
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:32,750
Even so...

109
00:04:32,834 --> 00:04:34,250
-Aah!
-Aah!

110
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:36,333
Off me, you furry creatures!

111
00:04:36,417 --> 00:04:38,250
All right, now! Turn him off!

112
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:39,750
Touch his nose! Touch his nose!

113
00:04:39,834 --> 00:04:40,917
Beep!

114
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,458
Powering down...

115
00:04:44,834 --> 00:04:46,750
Cursed to depart,

116
00:04:46,834 --> 00:04:50,250
having only just known your beauty.

117
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:51,792
Ohh!

118
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:57,000
Poor Daddy Robot.

119
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:02,959
Screwdriver.

120
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:04,125
Screwdriver.

121
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:06,166
-Please fix him.

122
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,792
- I'll try my best.

123
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,667
These circuits are badly damaged.

124
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,959
-Aww.
-Ha!

125
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:12,917
It's strange, though.

126
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,625
Daddy Robots don't usually
go crazy like that.

127
00:05:16,709 --> 00:05:20,458
Well, actually, it's our fault.

128
00:05:20,542 --> 00:05:24,667
We ordered Daddy Robot
to tidy the playroom for us.

129
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:27,291
And that's when he tried to
throw you in the wheelie bin?

130
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:28,375
Yeah.

131
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:30,667
Oh, I see.

132
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,458
Okay. I'll tell you a secret.

133
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:37,875
Daddy Robots will always find
the <i>easiest </i>way to do a job.

134
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:39,291
-Oh!
-Oh!

135
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:41,250
Just... like...

136
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,250
-kids!

137
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:45,709
I hope he's okay.

138
00:05:45,792 --> 00:05:47,875
Boooeeee!

139
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:49,709
Hello, Daddy Robot.

140
00:05:49,792 --> 00:05:51,208
How are you feeling?

141
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:52,458
Doo-doo-doo-doo- doo-doo!

142
00:05:52,542 --> 00:05:55,625
I dreamt I met a robot angel.

143
00:05:55,709 --> 00:05:56,709
Zzt!

144
00:05:56,792 --> 00:05:59,083
Hello, Master. What are my orders?

145
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:00,083
Brrrp!

146
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:01,083
Follow us.

147
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:02,709
Bip bip bip bip brrt brrp.

148
00:06:02,792 --> 00:06:04,458
Now sit down.

149
00:06:04,542 --> 00:06:06,709
Zzt! Yes, Master?

150
00:06:06,792 --> 00:06:08,583
Now lie back.

151
00:06:08,667 --> 00:06:11,000
Zzt! Are you sure, Master?

152
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:13,792
Zzt! Shouldn't I tidy
something up for you?

153
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:14,917
-No.
-No.

154
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,709
We order you to relax, Daddy Robot.

155
00:06:17,792 --> 00:06:19,041
Bzzt! Zzt! Zzzt!

156
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:20,542
-Zzzt! Zzzt!

157
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:23,041
I've never relaxed before.

158
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:24,417
Is this right?

159
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,208
Usually, you close your eyes.

160
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:28,458
Brrr...

161
00:06:28,542 --> 00:06:29,750
brrrt!

162
00:06:29,834 --> 00:06:31,750
Look who's here!

163
00:06:31,834 --> 00:06:33,500
Brrrt! Hello again.

164
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,083
Boop boop rrrrrr!

165
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:37,709
Cheese and crackers.

166
00:06:37,792 --> 00:06:40,250
Beeboop boop boop boop. Zzzt! Zzzt.

167
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,208
You robots relax.

168
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:44,166
<i>We're </i>gonna tidy the playroom.

169
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,458
Come on, Bingo.

170
00:06:45,542 --> 00:06:47,458
-Bye, robots!
-Bye, robots!

171
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,583
This... feels like... a robo-dream.

172
00:06:53,667 --> 00:06:55,959
Well, kiss me before you wake up.

173
00:06:59,417 --> 00:07:02,166
-Oooh!
-Oooh!
