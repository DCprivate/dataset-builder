1
00:00:06,458 --> 00:00:07,417
Mum!

2
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:13,083
Dad!

3
00:00:17,834 --> 00:00:18,667
Bingo!

4
00:00:22,834 --> 00:00:24,917
- Bluey!

5
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:31,500
Ladies and gentlemen,

6
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:36,125
I will now play for you
the rondo "Alla Turca."

7
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:38,375
Hmm, hmm, hmm!

8
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:49,792
-Hey! Piano!

9
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:52,750
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm terribly sorry.

10
00:00:52,834 --> 00:00:56,417
I seem to be having a little bit
of trouble with my piano!

11
00:00:59,542 --> 00:01:02,083
Dad! I want to be the piano.

12
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:04,208
No! It's still my turn.

13
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:06,583
Taking turns can be difficult.

14
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:10,083
Dad! She's had this many turns!

15
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:12,208
You can be the bum bongos!

16
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:13,792
-Bum bumda bum, bum bongos!

17
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:15,917
Bum bumda bum, bum bongos!

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,959
Bum bumda bum, bum bongos!

19
00:01:18,041 --> 00:01:19,417
Bum bumda bum, bum bongos!

20
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,792
Bum, bumda, bum...

21
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:24,333
Ooh! Island rhythms!

22
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,333
Bum bumda bum, bum bongos!

23
00:01:26,417 --> 00:01:30,542
<i>This episode of </i>Bluey
<i>is called </i>The Magic Xylophone!

24
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:37,625
Where are the <i>real </i>bongos?

25
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:41,458
Bluey! Look!

26
00:01:41,542 --> 00:01:42,625
Huh?

27
00:01:42,709 --> 00:01:44,208
Oh, no! The--

28
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:47,000
Quick, Bingo! Get the dinger thing!

29
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:48,875
Let me up! Let me out of here!

30
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:50,667
Got it! Do a ding!

31
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,875
Freeze!

32
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:53,333
-Y--

33
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:58,667
Yeah! The Magic Xylophone!

34
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:11,291
Mum, come and look at this!

35
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:12,625
Oh, look!

36
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:14,917
It's just like when we first met.

37
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:17,333
Unfreeze!

38
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:19,959
-What?!

39
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:22,250
How did I get fingers up my nose?

40
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:25,208
Oh. The Magic Xylophone!

41
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:26,917
Give me that xylophone!

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,041
-Freeze!
-Give me that --

43
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,875
Bingo, let's get the pens!

44
00:02:37,917 --> 00:02:40,917
Oh, what a splendid mustache you have.

45
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:44,458
Ooh! Lovely.

46
00:02:45,792 --> 00:02:48,291
It's <i>my </i>turn to unfreeze him.

47
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:49,208
Unfreeze!

48
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:52,417
-What?!

49
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,250
Arghh! You kids!

50
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:55,875
- Run!
-Aaah!

51
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:57,959
-Give me the magic

52
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:59,291
xylophone!

53
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:00,625
-Gotcha!
-Aaaah!

54
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,375
Yaha! Too slow, Mr Mustache!

55
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:08,000
Bluey, you're taking
all the turns freezing.

56
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:10,542
Come on, Bingo. Let's get the teddies.

57
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,542
Okay.

58
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,834
I'm off to work!

59
00:03:25,917 --> 00:03:28,542
Mum! Mum! Look at Dad now!

60
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:33,750
This loose hair's been
bugging me all morning.

61
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:37,500
Okay, I'll unfreeze him.

62
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,166
I want to do it.

63
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,291
Mum, Bluey's not
letting me have any turns.

64
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,917
Bluey, if you don't
take turns with people,

65
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,875
people won't take turns with <i>you.</i>

66
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,709
But Bingo's too slow.

67
00:03:48,792 --> 00:03:50,333
Dad will catch her.

68
00:03:50,417 --> 00:03:52,041
No, I'm not.

69
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:53,750
You can either take turns

70
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:56,375
or I'll bring the xylophone
to work with me.

71
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:57,583
I'll freeze my boss.

72
00:03:57,667 --> 00:03:58,542
-No!
-No!

73
00:03:58,625 --> 00:03:59,917
Nnnn! Nnnn!

74
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,834
Well, you know what to do, then.

75
00:04:01,917 --> 00:04:03,041
I'll see you later.

76
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:06,333
Just make sure you unfreeze him
for toilet breaks, okay?

77
00:04:06,417 --> 00:04:07,542
-Okay.
-Okay.

78
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,291
-Here, Bingo.

79
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,875
But stand right back here.

80
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:14,083
That way, you could get a head start.

81
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:16,709
He runs really fast when he's mad.

82
00:04:16,792 --> 00:04:18,542
Okay. Unfreeze!

83
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:19,583
-Ohh!

84
00:04:20,667 --> 00:04:22,250
There you are!

85
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:23,667
-Grrr!
-Run, Bingo!

86
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,125
Back inside!

87
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,000
Bingo! Bluey!

88
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:29,500
Come back here!

89
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:30,792
Where are they?!

90
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:32,542
I can't find them anywhere!

91
00:04:33,542 --> 00:04:36,375
Oh, maybe they went downstairs.

92
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,583
I can't hear him.

93
00:04:41,667 --> 00:04:43,792
I think we should freeze him,
just in case.

94
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:45,083
Give me the xylophone.

95
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:47,041
No, I want to freeze him!

96
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:49,291
You've had all the freezing turns.

97
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:51,208
Bingo! Let go!

98
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:56,166
Freedom!

99
00:04:57,542 --> 00:04:58,417
Got it!

100
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:02,875
You ding-dongs were too busy squabbling.

101
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:04,000
-Freeze!

102
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:05,500
-Aaaah!

103
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:07,291
-Freeze, freeze, freeze!

104
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:10,250
Oh, never mind. She'll keep.

105
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:15,250
Now, look at this lovely new garden gnome.

106
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:21,041
Ahh. This is the perfect spot.

107
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:22,959
Oh! Wait a minute!

108
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:26,041
It's got a little bit
of felt pen on the fingers.

109
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,333
Probably from some mischief!

110
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:29,625
I'd better get the hose.

111
00:05:29,709 --> 00:05:31,917
Nnn! Nnnnnnn!

112
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,792
Unfreeze me!

113
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,000
-Unfreeze!

114
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:37,083
Thanks, Bingo.

115
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:38,583
Dad's gone to get the hose.

116
00:05:38,667 --> 00:05:40,625
-Let's go and hi--

117
00:05:42,834 --> 00:05:47,417
Bluey, you always
never take turns with me.

118
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,500
You just take all of the turns.

119
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,500
And it makes me feel sad.

120
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:55,375
I will unfreeze you if you promise

121
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:58,166
you will let me have turns, too.

122
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,458
Blink two times if "Yes."

123
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:05,917
<i>♪ Gonna hose my dirty garden gnome ♪</i>

124
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,750
<i>♪ Gonna hose it good, unh ♪</i>

125
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Okay, time for a little bath,
garden gnome!

126
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:14,375
Nnn! Nnnn!

127
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:18,583
Ohhhhh, yeah!

128
00:06:18,667 --> 00:06:19,500
Huh?

129
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:21,375
-Freeze!

130
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:23,125
We tricked you!

131
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:24,917
Bingo unfroze me.

132
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,792
I was just pretending.

133
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,542
Now, Bingo!

134
00:06:29,542 --> 00:06:30,417
Blub-blub-blub!

135
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:45,667
Here, Bingo. You can unfreeze him.

136
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,166
Thanks, Bluey.

137
00:06:52,542 --> 00:06:53,792
Not just yet.

138
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:56,417
I like the Daddy water fountain.
