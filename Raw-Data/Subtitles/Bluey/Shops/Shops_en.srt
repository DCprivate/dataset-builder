Let's set up a shop.

[all] Yeah!

15
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:37,709
Okay, but promise we won't take ages
deciding stuff, okay?

16
00:00:37,792 --> 00:00:39,500
Well, we'll have to see.

[Bluey This episode of Bluey
is called Shops.

18
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:46,375
This can be the shop.

19
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:48,208
And this can be the till.

20
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:50,750
And this is the bit
where it goes "doot, doot!"

21
00:00:50,834 --> 00:00:53,500
This can be the door to the shop.

22
00:00:53,583 --> 00:00:56,166
And it has a bell
when you walk through it.

23
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,583
And I'll be the customer.

24
00:00:57,667 --> 00:00:58,959
Da-ding!

25
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:00,583
Hello, shopkeeper.
I'd like to --

26
00:01:00,667 --> 00:01:03,250
Stop, hang on.
We have to decide who to be.

27
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:07,750
Bluey, you promised we wouldn't
take long deciding stuff.

28
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:10,417
We can't start if we
don't know who we all are.

29
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,834
I'll be the shopkeeper.

30
00:01:11,917 --> 00:01:14,625
Aw, I wanted to be the shopkeeper.

31
00:01:14,709 --> 00:01:16,375
Chloe, you can be the assistant.

32
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:18,750
They hand stuff to the shopkeeper.

33
00:01:18,834 --> 00:01:21,417
Does the assistant get to go "doot"?

34
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,000
Um, yes, but only when
the shopkeeper is sick

35
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:25,959
and has to stay home.

36
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:28,041
Oh. Okay.

37
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:29,542
Are you feeling sick at all?

38
00:01:29,625 --> 00:01:30,750
No, I'm fine.

39
00:01:30,834 --> 00:01:32,166
I'll be a customer, too.

40
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,375
Yes, you and Mackenzie are customers.

41
00:01:34,458 --> 00:01:36,583
Hooray! Okay, let's go.

42
00:01:36,667 --> 00:01:37,750

Hello!

43
00:01:37,834 --> 00:01:38,750
Wait!

44
00:01:38,834 --> 00:01:40,125
What is it now?

45
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:41,917
Honey, why don't you be a kitten?

46
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,542
Good idea.
Meow! Meow! Meow!

47
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:46,125
I'll be your owner.

48
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:47,709
Good kitty!

00:01:47,792 --> 00:01:50,000
-Meow!
-Okay, let's start!

50
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:52,417
Da-ding! Hello!
I'd like to buy a --

51
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,208
-Wait!
-What?!

52
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:55,917
What kind of store is this?

53
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:58,000
How about a kitten store?

54
00:01:58,083 --> 00:01:59,709
What's a kitten store?

55
00:01:59,792 --> 00:02:01,458
A store that sells kittens.

56
00:02:01,542 --> 00:02:03,834
-But I've already got a kitten.
-Oh, yeah.

57
00:02:03,917 --> 00:02:07,750
How about a store that sells
things for kittens?

58
00:02:07,834 --> 00:02:08,875
[all] Yeah!

59
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,375
Okay. Da-ding!

60
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:13,000
Wait! Assistant,
help me find things

61
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:14,417
so we can sell for kittens!

62
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,834
Wait. What?

63
00:02:15,917 --> 00:02:17,333
We won't be long!

64
00:02:17,417 --> 00:02:19,250
What do kittens like?

65
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:20,834
Um, they like lilly-pillys.

66
00:02:20,917 --> 00:02:22,041
Oh, yeah.

67
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:23,417
These can be the kitten treats.

68
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,250
They're a bit too round.

69
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:26,667
They're not all round.

70
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,875
Some are a bit bumpy.

71
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:30,083
-Oh, yeah.
-Hurry up!

72
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:33,291
Mackenzie, you're always
in such a hurry.

73
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:36,792
We can't play shop if we don't
have anything to sell.

74
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:37,875
Okay!

75
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:40,000
Can we please start?

76
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:41,375
Yes, yes, yes.

77
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:43,208
Bluey, are you
feeling sick yet?

78
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:44,250
No, I'm fine.

79
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:45,834
Okay Mackenzie, go!

80
00:02:45,917 --> 00:02:47,291
Finally!

81
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,667
Da-ding!
Hello!

82
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,041
-Wait!
-Ugggh!

83
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:52,000
We don't have anything for money.

84
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:53,583
It doesn't matter!

85
00:02:53,667 --> 00:02:56,166
You can't buy anything
if you don't have money.

86
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,792
Oh, yeah, that's true.

87
00:02:57,875 --> 00:03:00,041
How about the round ones are money,

88
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:02,083
and the bumpy ones
are kitten treats?

89
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:03,125
Okey dokey.

90
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:04,291
Take these, Mackenzie.

91
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:05,834
These are the dollar bucks.

92
00:03:05,917 --> 00:03:07,291
Okay, let's get going.

93
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:08,583
Da-ding! Hello!

94
00:03:08,667 --> 00:03:10,125
-Wait!
-Uggggh!

95
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,375
You also need a kitten birthday cake,

96
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:15,083
but I'm going to say,
"Sorry, we've run out."

97
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:16,542
And then you have to be sad.

98
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:18,375
Birthday cake?

99
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:21,417
Bluey, I want it to be that we
do have a kitten birthday cake.

100
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,083
Okay, we do have a kitten birthday cake,

101
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:26,417
but you have to be sad 'cause
it's not the one you want.

102
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,709
I don't know what
you're talking about.

103
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:30,417
Let's just start!

104
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,583
Da-ding! Hello!

105
00:03:31,667 --> 00:03:32,792
-Hello!
-I'd like to buy a --

106
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,709
-Stop!
-Ugggggh!

107
00:03:34,792 --> 00:03:37,875
I don't think kittens
should be able to talk.

108
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:39,166
Really?

109
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,583
Yes.
Kittens definitely can't talk.

110
00:03:41,667 --> 00:03:44,291
You just have to go like this
when you want something --

111
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:46,250
Meow! Meow!

112
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:47,417
Meow! Meow!

113
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,041
Rrow! Rrow!

114
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:51,792
[all] Meow! Meow! Meow!

115
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,000
Meoooow!

116
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:55,208
Okay, let's go. Da-ding!

117
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:56,208
Wait!

118
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:58,542
What is it now?

119
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:00,417
I think I want to be the kitten.

120
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,917
[groaning]

121
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,458
[gasps] That means I can
be the shopkeeper!

122
00:04:04,542 --> 00:04:06,125
Doot! Doot!
Doot!

123
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:08,125
But I like being the kitten.

124
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:10,834
Please, Honey,
you can be the shopkeeper.

125
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,208
Doot!
What? No way!

126
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:15,041
Well, how about
the assistant?

127
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:17,500
I'll only swap if I'll be
the kitten owner.

128
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:19,417
But I'm the kitten owner.

129
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,500
You can be the assistant, Mackenzie.

130
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:24,250
But I don't want to
be the assistant.

131
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:25,750
Ohh!

132
00:04:25,834 --> 00:04:28,125
I'll only swap if I can be the shopkeeper.

133
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:29,834
Then I can doot things!

134
00:04:29,917 --> 00:04:31,208
Dooting is fun.

135
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:32,583
Doot! Doot!

136
00:04:32,667 --> 00:04:34,000
Doot! Doot!

137
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:36,291
[all] Doot! Doot!
Doot! Doot!

138
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:38,458
Chloe, can Mackenzie
be the shopkeeper

139
00:04:38,542 --> 00:04:40,208
and you be the assistant?

140
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:42,000
But the assistant doesn't doot!

141
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:44,458
But she hands stuff to be dooted.

142
00:04:44,542 --> 00:04:45,500
Unh-unh.

143
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:48,750
Well, we can't start
until someone is the assistant.

144
00:04:48,834 --> 00:04:50,291
Ohhhh!

145
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:54,125
I'll do whatever we need to do
to start playing shops.

146
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:55,792
Will you be the assistant?

147
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:57,250
-Fine!
-Great.

148
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:59,667
Oh, but then we don't
have a customer.

149
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,041
Grrrr!
I knew it!

150
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:04,458
We're never gonna
start a shop.

151
00:05:04,542 --> 00:05:06,125
I'm leaving!

152
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:07,709
Mackenzie!

153
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:12,667
Doot.

154
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:18,375
Mackenzie!

155
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:20,875
Can you come back and play shops?

156
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:22,375
What's the use?

157
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:25,291
We'll never, ever get to start.

158
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:28,709
You just want to keep making up
more and more things.

159
00:05:28,792 --> 00:05:31,000
That's true.

160
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:34,792
But you just want to start
before we know who anyone is.

161
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:38,709
Yeah I do, don't I?

162
00:05:38,792 --> 00:05:42,500
Okay, Bluey, I promise not
to start until you're ready.

163
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:45,291
And I promise I'll be ready
when you start.

164
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:46,250
[all] Hooray!

165
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:47,834
Let's play!

166
00:05:47,917 --> 00:05:50,083
Hang on, you still don't
have an assistant.

167
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,041
Can I play?

168
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:53,041
[all] Yes!

169
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:55,250
Thanks. Who can I be?

170
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:56,959
[all] The assistant!

171
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:58,917
[laughter]

172
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,083
Great.

173
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:01,667
Right!

174
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,083
Chloe is the shopkeeper...

175
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:04,667
Mackenzie is the customer...

176
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,083
Honey is the cat...

177
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:08,500
and Rusty is the assistant!

178
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:09,709
[all] Yay!

179
00:06:09,792 --> 00:06:11,250
And Bluey is my other cat!

180
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:12,500
[all] Yes!

181
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,333
Wait, we've only got one lead.

182
00:06:14,417 --> 00:06:16,041
We sell leads!

183
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,667
