This is the doctor's office!

15
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:33,750
Hello. It's Edna speaking.

16
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:35,083
How are you?

17
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:37,417
Hello, I need to see the doctor now.

18
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,709
Mm, yes, okay.

19
00:00:39,792 --> 00:00:41,917
Sure, okay, we'll see you in 15 months.

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,375
Bye. Click.

21
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:47,291
Thank you, Doctor.
My schnozz feels great.

22
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:49,542
Just keep it on for six months.

23
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:51,125
See ya!

24
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:53,375
Please choose a lollipop on your way out.

25
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:55,083
Why, thank you.

26
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:56,959
Ooh, lychee.

27
00:00:57,041 --> 00:01:00,542
[Bluey] This episode of Bluey
is called The Doctor.

28
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:03,083
Sorry about that.
How can I help?

29
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:04,792
I need to see the doctor.

30
00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:07,500
Oh, yes, I'm sure we can
squeeze you in tightly.

31
00:01:07,583 --> 00:01:08,917
Great!

32
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,333
Now, what's wrong with you today?

33
00:01:10,417 --> 00:01:12,417
Nothing.
I'm fine.

34
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,000
Honey, playing doctors,

35
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:16,375
you have to make up
something wrong with you.

36
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:18,583
Oh, yes, of course.

37
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:22,500
What do you think
should be wrong with me?

38
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:23,875
It's up to you.

39
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:27,125
Um, what if I bumped
my knee? [giggles]

40
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:29,000
Okay, here's a clipboard.

41
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:30,333
Please take a seat.

42
00:01:30,417 --> 00:01:31,583
The doctor won't be long.

43
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:35,542
Honey, you have to hobble when you walk.

44
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:37,542
Oh, yes.

45
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:44,542
Next patient, please.

46
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:46,291
That's me!

47
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:48,625
Hobble!

48
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:50,625
What seems to be the matter?

49
00:01:50,709 --> 00:01:52,542
She's bumped her knee, Doctor.

50
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:54,333
Oh. You sure that's it?

51
00:01:54,417 --> 00:01:55,750
Yeah, that's it.

52
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:59,333
Okay, we'll have that fixed in a jiffy.

53
00:01:59,417 --> 00:02:01,750
[groans] I need to see the doctor!

54
00:02:01,834 --> 00:02:04,583
Ooh, there's a crocodile on my head!

55
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:07,417
Oh, my.
This is a real pickle.

56
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,583
-Don't worry.
-Ohh!

57
00:02:08,667 --> 00:02:10,625
We'll fix that in a jiffy.

58
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:13,333
Edna, hold my appointments.

59
00:02:13,417 --> 00:02:16,166
Oh, I'm sorry dear.
Please take a seat.

60
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,208
I'm sure the doctor won't be long.

61
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:21,000
[Bingo] This is gonna take ages!

62
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:23,000
Oh, okay.

63
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:27,375
I'm just trying to pull the mouth open!

64
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:28,500
[objects clattering]

65
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:29,792
[Lucky] Ugh!

66
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:31,125
-This might sting...
-Ugh!

67
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:32,917
...but just for a little bit!

68
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,166
-Aah!
-Aah!

69
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,291
[breathing heavily]

70
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:37,083
He's a wily one!

71
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:38,375
Yaaaah!

72
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,166
Oh, careful, Doctor! Aah!

73
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,125
Would you like a cup of tea
while you wait?

74
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:43,583
Yes, thanks.

75
00:02:43,667 --> 00:02:45,333
-Ugh!
-Yaaaah!

76
00:02:45,417 --> 00:02:46,750
Here you go.

77
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:48,709
Are you sure you haven't
been attacked

78
00:02:48,792 --> 00:02:50,417
by a giraffe or something?

79
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,375
-Um, no.
-[Bingo] Yah!

80
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:54,291
Cause that would be a real pickle.

81
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:55,458
[Bingo] There it goes!

82
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:56,458
[Pop, whistle]

83
00:02:56,542 --> 00:02:57,875
[thud]

84
00:02:57,959 --> 00:02:59,333
Oh. Looks like she's done.

85
00:02:59,417 --> 00:03:01,959
Out you come.

86
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:03,542
Beautiful, Doctor.

87
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:06,333
Just keep the bandages
on for 11 years.

88
00:03:06,417 --> 00:03:08,041
Choose a lollipop.

89
00:03:09,667 --> 00:03:10,959
See ya.

90
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,375
Okay, who's next?

91
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:13,583
That's me.

92
00:03:13,667 --> 00:03:16,000
Oh, yes -- sore knee.
Right this way.

93
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:18,375
Help! I cuddled a cactus!

94
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:19,625
Oh, no!

95
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:21,041
[all] Aah!

96
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:22,458
And then a crocodile
flew out of the sky

97
00:03:22,542 --> 00:03:23,625
and bit me on the bottom!

98
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:27,333
My stars!
This is a real pickle!

99
00:03:27,417 --> 00:03:31,417
Don't worry. We'll have you
fixed in a jiffy.

100
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,458
Oww, oww, oww,
oww, oww!

101
00:03:32,542 --> 00:03:35,125
Edna, hold my appointments!

102
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:36,166
Oww, oww, oww, oww!

103
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,250
Ohh!

104
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:39,917
But what about my knee?

105
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,083
-[objects rustling]
-[Snickers groans] Oww!

106
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:45,542
[Bingo] Aah! Wriggling will just
make it harder!

107
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:48,458
Oh, I'm sorry about the wait, Honey.

108
00:03:48,542 --> 00:03:51,417
Am I definitely
the next patient, Bluey?

109
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,000
You are definitely
the next patient.

110
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:55,917
We need to see the doctor!

111
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,500
Oh, my!

112
00:03:57,583 --> 00:04:01,125
I was hanging out the washing,
and my arms fell off!

113
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:04,417
And I got bitten
by seven scorpions.

114
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,834
Oh, my, my!

115
00:04:05,917 --> 00:04:09,000
Oh, this looks like
a real pickle.

116
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,083
-It is!
-It is!

117
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,709
I'm never gonna see the doctor.

118
00:04:12,792 --> 00:04:14,166
Don't worry, Honey.

119
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,500
I promise you'll be the next patient.

120
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:17,792
Really?

121
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:19,667
Yes.
Definitely.

122
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,291
Yaaaah!

123
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,375
I need a doctor!

124
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:24,709
What's wrong, Rusty?

125
00:04:24,792 --> 00:04:27,166
I accidentally ate a hippopotamus.

126
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:31,458
And now when I burp,
I burp out baby hippopotamuses.

127
00:04:31,542 --> 00:04:32,709
Burp!

128
00:04:32,792 --> 00:04:33,709
[all] Aah!

129
00:04:33,792 --> 00:04:35,083
Oh, no! Baby hippos!

130
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:36,250
Quick, Indy, grab it!

131
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:37,542
But I've got no arms!

132
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:38,709
Aah!

133
00:04:38,792 --> 00:04:40,542
[Coco] Get 'em!

134
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,333
Get 'em out!
Get him!

135
00:04:42,417 --> 00:04:43,583
Come on, little wriggly one!

136
00:04:43,667 --> 00:04:45,458
Get away, baby hippo!

137
00:04:45,542 --> 00:04:46,583
Burp!

138
00:04:46,667 --> 00:04:47,709
-Aah!
-Two more!

139
00:04:47,792 --> 00:04:49,625
Aah! Hippos everywhere!

140
00:04:49,709 --> 00:04:52,750
Oh, my, goodness,
this is a real pickle.

141
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:55,291
Rusty, you best come
in here right away.

142
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:57,291
Ohhhh!

143
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:59,417
Edna, hold my appointments.

144
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,208
I knew it.

145
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,166
-[Bingo] Stay still!
-[Rusty] Burp!

146
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,667
How many hippos have you got in there?

147
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,834
Can I have a lollipop?

148
00:05:07,917 --> 00:05:08,834
-Yaaah!
-Burp!

149
00:05:08,917 --> 00:05:10,041
[objects clattering]

150
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:11,208
Don't be sad, Honey.

151
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:12,792
Ohhh!

152
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:17,333
Everyone's problem is
a real pickle, except mine.

153
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:19,000
-Burp!
-Oh, my!

154
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:21,208
-Aah!
-Oh, there's another one!

155
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:23,291
Burp!
They're everywhere!

156
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:24,875
Yahh!
Come here!

157
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,291
-Yaaaah!
-[laughs]

158
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:38,959
[laughter]

159
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:41,375
You always make me laugh.

160
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:44,834
Yeah, I always make you laugh.

161
00:05:44,917 --> 00:05:47,125
Come here, you baby hippo!

162
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:49,291
[grunting]

163
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:50,458
Do it again.

164
00:05:50,542 --> 00:05:51,917
Do something funny.

165
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,583
Okay, watch this.

166
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:57,125
Now, for most dogs,

167
00:05:57,208 --> 00:06:01,208
their tail wags,
and their body stays still.

168
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,875
But not me.
Ta-da!

169
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:05,125
[laughter]

170
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:08,166
That's so funny!

171
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,000
Oh, thanks, Doctor.

172
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:13,166
I won't eat any more
hippopotamuses again.

173
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,750
[breathing heavily]
I think there are --

174
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:19,875
there are some lollipops
around here...somewhere.

175
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:22,208
Oh, my stars!

176
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:24,458
Your tail and your body
are all mixed up!

177
00:06:24,542 --> 00:06:26,333
[laughing] Her body's wagging!

178
00:06:26,417 --> 00:06:28,959
[laughing] But her tail is still!

179
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:30,750
This is a real pickle.

180
00:06:30,834 --> 00:06:32,750
Really?
A pickle?

181
00:06:32,834 --> 00:06:35,333
This is the biggest pickle
I've ever seen.

182
00:06:35,417 --> 00:06:37,291
Come with me right away.

183
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,542
[gasps, giggles]

184
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,291
