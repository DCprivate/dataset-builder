Uh, Chilli?

00:00:33,959 --> 00:00:35,583
Asleep.

I know!

20
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,625
Let's go in the wagon!

21
00:00:45,709 --> 00:00:46,750
Yeah!

22
00:00:46,834 --> 00:00:48,583
Oh, not the wagon.

Seatbelts!

28
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:03,166
Dad! There are no seatbelts.

29
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,500
Oh, yeah!

30
00:01:04,583 --> 00:01:05,583
Off we go!

[laughs]
Yeah!

32
00:01:10,417 --> 00:01:14,291
First, I'm going to go
across and then back.

33
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:17,375
Then I'm going to
do skipbar one way,

34
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:20,125
and then double skipbar
on the way back.

35
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:23,041
Oh, Jasmine,
your hair is so knotty.

00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:26,500
Morning, Bandit!
Hey, kids.

37
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:27,750
Ooh, you're up early.

38
00:01:27,834 --> 00:01:29,083
Gotta be done.

00:01:34,542 --> 00:01:36,333
Bluey, I'm talking.

43
00:01:36,417 --> 00:01:38,667
[chuckles] I'll leave you guys to it.

44
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:39,709
Bye, girls.

45
00:01:39,792 --> 00:01:42,375
Oh, okay. See ya, Rocko.

46
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:44,875
Bluey, if I'm talking
to another grown-up,

47
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:46,917
you don't interrupt like that, okay?

48
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,667
Dad, I've got a plan.

49
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,625
You're not allowed
to stop the wagon

50
00:01:50,709 --> 00:01:52,375
and chat to your friends.

51
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:55,291
You have to take us
straight to the monkey bars.

52
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:56,750
No stopping.

53
00:01:56,834 --> 00:01:58,709
Hmm.
Interesting plan.

54
00:01:58,792 --> 00:02:00,792
I know --
how about this plan?

55
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:03,709
I'll do what I want, and you
don't tell me what to do.

56
00:02:03,792 --> 00:02:05,542
No, I don't like that plan.

57
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,583
We'll stick with mine, thanks.

58
00:02:07,667 --> 00:02:09,125
Okay.
No problems.

Wait! No!

61
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,583
Yay! We're going home again!

62
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:17,291
Okay, your plan.

63
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:18,583
Good decision.

64
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:19,875
[groans]

65
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:21,709
Okay, how about this?

66
00:02:21,792 --> 00:02:24,125
If I'm talking to a grown-up
and you want me,

67
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:26,583
you just come up
and put your hand on my arm.

68
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:30,709
So now I know
that you want to talk to me.

69
00:02:30,792 --> 00:02:34,500
Then I'll do this to show you
that I know you're there

70
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:36,250
and that
you want to talk to me.

71
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:38,083
-What do you think?
-Yeah!

72
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,792
All right!
High five!

73
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,500
Aah!
Got something in my eye.

74
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:44,083
[laughs]

75
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:45,875
Let's go!

76
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:56,291
So, then, after I do skipbar,

77
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:59,083
I'm going to go upside down
and be a fruit bat.

78
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:03,250
Oh, Jasmine, is it really
your birthday today?

79
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,542
I'll have to get you
something nice.

80
00:03:06,542 --> 00:03:07,959
Morning, Bandit.

81
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:09,458
You're up early.

82
00:03:09,542 --> 00:03:10,709

How's the little fella?

Yeah, he's good!

86
00:03:14,917 --> 00:03:16,542
He's just learning to roll over.

87
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:18,583
Oh, wow! Good boy.

88
00:03:18,667 --> 00:03:20,667
Yeah, we're all stoked.

89
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,625
-Hi, Bluey.
-Hi.

90
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:25,166
He keeps me up all night, Bandit.

91
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,583
My word.

92
00:03:26,667 --> 00:03:27,917
Yes, Bluey?

93
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,542
Can you please finish talking now
so we can go to the monkey bars?

94
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:34,875
Oh, you're heading
to the monkey bars?

95
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,709
I'd better let you get back to it.

96
00:03:36,792 --> 00:03:38,291
Have fun, Bluey.

97
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:40,542
Thank you.

98
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,333
Okay, let's go!

99
00:03:42,417 --> 00:03:44,375
Now, that was
much better, Bluey.

100
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:47,125
You didn't interrupt, you
let me know you wanted to talk,

101
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:48,709
and you waited till I was ready.

102
00:03:48,792 --> 00:03:50,583
-Well done.
-Thanks.

103
00:03:50,667 --> 00:03:53,917
I still just need you to be
more patient, though. Okay?

104
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,291
Okay.

105
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:57,458
I just find it hard to be patient.

106
00:03:57,542 --> 00:03:58,875
I'll give you a hint.

107
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,250
Next time, just watch
what your sister does.

108
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:02,291
Okay.

109
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:03,375
High five!

Come with me, Jasmine.

121
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:34,500
We need to get dressed for the party.

122

Jasmine, my dear...

126
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,583
we really must get going.

127
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:59,542
Oh, no!
Our wagon is broken down!

128
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:02,417
How are we gonna
get to the party?

to her party on time.
