[Dad] Taxi!

00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,291
I'm in a big hurry, taxi driver.

21
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:45,083
I need to get to the airport.

22
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:46,959
Hop in. I can take you to the airport.

23
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:48,083
Thanks.

I'm late for my flight to Tasmania.

Yes, sir!

26
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:54,959
Um, can I just check --
you won't break down or get lost

27
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:57,166
or pick up another passenger, will you?

28
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:58,667
Of course not.

29
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,083
Oh, good. 'Cause I --

00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:14,959
Please do.

36
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:16,166
What's going on?

37
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,250
Be with you in a moment, sir!

38
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:20,667
Feel free to get out
and have a stretch.

39
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,667
I haven't got time for this!

40
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,500
Watch out, sir.
Watch out.

Click!

45
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,917
I'm taking Millicent
to Stumblytastics.

46
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,083
You got it.

47
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:36,000

Hang on!

49
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:39,458
I thought we were going
to the airport first.

50
00:01:39,542 --> 00:01:41,458
Millicent will not be late!

51
00:01:41,542 --> 00:01:42,875
Okay.

52
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:44,792
It's fine.
It's probably on the way.

53
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:46,458
Let's ask SatNav.

54
00:01:46,542 --> 00:01:47,917
Oh, here we go.

00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:53,041
SatNav, take us to Stumblytastics, please.

57
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:54,542
[Mum Monotone] Okay.

58
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:58,166
Calculating shortest route
to Stumblytastics.

59
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,542
Mm-hmm.

60
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:03,583
Continue on this road
for 500 meters.

61
00:02:03,667 --> 00:02:05,083
Thanks, SatNav.

62
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:07,375
SatNav will get us there
in a jiffy.

63
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:08,792
Well, I should hope so!

Millicent is getting carsick.

Don't let her vomit on my seats!

68
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:18,583
[Mum] In 5 meters,
turn left onto...

[Mum] Or was it right?

73
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:29,667
I think it was right.

74
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,166
I'm not quite sure.

75
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:34,083
[all] Whoaaaa!

76
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:36,583
Let's just see
where this takes us.

We're completely lost!

79
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:42,375
Almost there, Millicent.

80
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:45,041
Oh! Wait! I recognize
that kebab shop.

81
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:46,625
Turn left here!

82
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:48,834
-Turn here!
-Okay!

83
00:02:48,917 --> 00:02:51,625
-Yowwww!
-Whoaaa!

00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:54,542
[Mum] Oh, no.
This isn't right.

85
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:55,792
Oh! Come on!

Waaa! Me sick!

90
00:03:01,792 --> 00:03:03,667
Quick!
Get on this roundabout!

91
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,792

SatNav, focus!

95
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:17,083

You have arrived at Stumblytastics.

106
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:39,875
To the best of my knowledge.

107
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:40,834
Finally!

108
00:03:40,917 --> 00:03:43,291
This isn't Stumblytastics.

109
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:44,667
Yeah, this is the zoo.

110
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,125
Beans on toast!

111
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:49,208
Why did you take us to the zoo?

112
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:53,083
I... really wanted...
to see... the penguins.

113
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,583
[giggles] Oh, SatNav.

114
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:57,500
I want to see the penguins, too.

115
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:59,166
Okay, let's go.

116
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,667
I'll get your stroller.

117
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,250
Unclick.

118
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:05,417
Other passenger,
feel free to have a stretch!

119
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,709
I don't want to have a stretch!

120
00:04:07,792 --> 00:04:08,959
Please!

121
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,417
Can't you just take me
to the airport?

122
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,291
I'm late for my flight!

123
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:14,333
Sure.

124
00:04:14,417 --> 00:04:15,959
Oh! Okay, let's go.

125
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:16,875
We can just make it.

126
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:17,875
Click!

127
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,709

Oh!
Goodness gravy!

133
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:31,333
Not to worry.
I'll call the mechanic.

Beeda-beeda-boop.

135
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,333
It's ringing.

Hello, mechanic?

Oh, the doodad.

152
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:01,875
Yeah, love. You need a new doodad.

00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:03,417
Okay, a new doodad.

154
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,959
It's this doodad.

155
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:07,583
Oh, right. A new doodad.

Will this take much longer?!

158

Fix, fix, fix.

159
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:14,166
There ya go, love.

160

-Phew!
-Click!

163
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:19,917
I think I can just
make my flight, if we hurry.

164
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,750
Okay, let's go!

165

170
00:05:31,792 --> 00:05:33,625
[old woman's voice]
How many do we need?

171
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:35,625
Oh,
I don't know.

172
00:05:35,709 --> 00:05:38,250
Oh! Hurry up,

Where is that airport?

187
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,583
Must be around here somewhere!

188
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,625
[breathlessly]
Oh! Hello!

189
00:06:12,709 --> 00:06:13,834
Is this the airport?

190
00:06:13,917 --> 00:06:15,333
Yes. You've just made it.

191
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:16,625
Boarding pass?

192
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,834
Oh.
Yes, of course.

194
00:06:19,917 --> 00:06:21,625
What's that smell?

195
00:06:21,709 --> 00:06:22,917
Baby vomit.

196
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,750
Oh. Well, the plane
is just through here.

197
00:06:25,834 --> 00:06:28,917
You have seat 4F,
just to your left.

198
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,750
Have a nice flight.

199
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,917
4D...4E...

200
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,875
4F! Here we go.

201
00:06:38,417 --> 00:06:40,959
What a day!

202
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:45,375
Millicent, I do hope
you don't get airsick, too.

203
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:46,625
Hello!

204
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:48,583
Arghh!
Don't take off!

205
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:49,959
I want to get off!

206
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:51,166
Where's the pilot?!

207
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,959
I demand to speak to the pilot!

208
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,417
Yoo-hoo!

209
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,500
That's me!

210
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,208
I'm the pilot!

211
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:00,709
Ohhh, biscuits!
