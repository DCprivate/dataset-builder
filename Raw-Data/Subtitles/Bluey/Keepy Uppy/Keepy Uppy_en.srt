1
00:00:06,208 --> 00:00:07,166
Mum!

2
00:00:11,792 --> 00:00:12,875
Dad!

3
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:18,667
Bingo!

4
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:25,125
- Bluey!

5
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:32,375
Ooh!

6
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:35,000
Morning, balloons!

7
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:39,083
I mean, morning, last balloon.

8
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:42,875
You ready?

9
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:43,834
Ready!

10
00:00:43,917 --> 00:00:45,583
Keep your arms up!

11
00:00:45,667 --> 00:00:47,875
-Aah!
- Again!

12
00:00:47,959 --> 00:00:48,917
Morning, Bluey!

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,625
Oh, what have you got there?

14
00:00:50,709 --> 00:00:51,959
This is my pet bird.

15
00:00:54,417 --> 00:00:57,291
She's saying good morniiiing!

16
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:59,625
Oh, good morning, pet birdie.

17
00:00:59,709 --> 00:01:00,792
Go free, birdie!

18
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:08,583
Oh, that's funny, is it?

19
00:01:08,667 --> 00:01:10,500
-Yeah!
-Yeah, it is.

20
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:13,417
Well, I've got a game for you.

21
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:15,250
Is it keepy uppy?

22
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:16,458
Yeah, it's keepy uppy.

23
00:01:16,542 --> 00:01:18,834
It's keepy uppy! Whoo!

24
00:01:18,917 --> 00:01:22,417
<i>This episode of </i>Bluey
<i>is called </i>Keepy Uppy.

25
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,000
What's keepy uppy?

26
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:26,750
You have to keep
the balloon in the air

27
00:01:26,834 --> 00:01:28,917
and can't let it
touch the ground.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,542
What happens
if it touches the ground?

29
00:01:31,709 --> 00:01:33,208
Oh, nothing Bingo.

30
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:34,583
It's just a game.

31
00:01:34,667 --> 00:01:35,583
Oh, okay.

32
00:01:35,667 --> 00:01:36,583
You ready?

33
00:01:36,667 --> 00:01:37,583
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

34
00:01:37,667 --> 00:01:39,208
Okay... go!

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,792
Yeah. Bwut!

36
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:44,375
Bwut!

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,875
Bwut!

38
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:47,125
Ah, Bingo, quick!

39
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:48,125
Yah!

40
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:50,041
Bwut!

41
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:51,875
Bwut!

42
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:53,125
I got it, Bluey!

43
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:54,834
Bwut! You, get it!

44
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:56,333
-I got it. I got it.
-Bluey, get it!

45
00:01:56,417 --> 00:01:57,834
Whoo!

46
00:01:57,917 --> 00:01:59,291
-I got it!
-Oh, good.

47
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:00,500
No no no, quick! Quick!

48
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:03,208
-Bwut!
-Ah, Mum, you're making it harder!

49
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:06,542
Okay, I'm gonna
cook brecky, kids.

50
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:07,750
-Bwut!
-Mum!

51
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:12,959
Look, what if we do small ones?

52
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:14,542
Bwut!

53
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:16,917
Bwut! This is so easy now.

54
00:02:17,917 --> 00:02:19,083
-Check it out, Mum!
-Bwut!

55
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:20,083
Bwut!

56
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:23,000
Hey, nice strategy,
balloon girls!

57
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:25,333
I'm a keepy uppy expert.

58
00:02:25,417 --> 00:02:27,750
Yep. But it's not as fun now.

59
00:02:27,834 --> 00:02:29,125
Can you make it hard again?

60
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:31,959
Sorry, pickle,
I've got my hands full.

61
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:34,750
Oh, good morning, everybody!

62
00:02:34,834 --> 00:02:36,417
Said good morning, everyone!

63
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,959
Ugh! Whaddup, party people?

64
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:40,750
Dad, we're playing keepy uppy.

65
00:02:40,834 --> 00:02:42,166
Can you make it harder?

66
00:02:42,542 --> 00:02:44,333
Ah! My newspaper.

67
00:02:44,417 --> 00:02:46,792
-Dad!
-Aah! Bingo, help!

68
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,125
I can't! I'm a newspaper!

69
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:52,125
-Oh, old so and so is at it again.

70
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:53,792
-Er, yes, yes.

71
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:56,375
Look! Wow.

72
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:58,000
Whoa. Look at that!

73
00:02:58,166 --> 00:02:59,166
Bluey, help!

74
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,125
I'll save ya, Bingo!

75
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:02,125
Let her go.

76
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:04,458
Oh, <i>you </i>want to read
the newspaper, Bluey?

77
00:03:04,542 --> 00:03:07,500
Okay, just don't do the sudoku.

78
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,083
Oh, look. Lovely orange juice.

79
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:12,667
Yes, please!

80
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,709
-Aah!
-Aah!

81
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,875
No, no, no! Bwut!

82
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:15,875
I'll get it!

83
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:17,125
That's it, Bingo! Eeee!

84
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:19,750
-Oh, dear child.

85
00:03:19,834 --> 00:03:21,625
You grow up so fast.

86
00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:23,375
Aw, Dad, let go!

87
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:24,834
Bingo, get it!

88
00:03:24,917 --> 00:03:26,792
Don't let it touch the ground!

89
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,083
Bluey, help!

90
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,750
I can't do it by myself!

91
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:32,125
Dear child, embrace your father.

92
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:35,000
Let go!

93
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:36,041
Bwut!

94
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,959
-Aah!
-I'll get it!

95
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:40,208
Oh, this heat is oppressive.

96
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:42,917
I'll just turn on this fan.

97
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:45,125
-Dad!
-Dad!

98
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:46,542
Mine! Mine!

99
00:03:47,542 --> 00:03:49,166
There's leaves everywhere!

100
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,041
Dad! Aaaah!

101
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:55,125
Ah, there's too many toys
on the ground! Bwut!

102
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:58,333
Who is responsible
for this mess?

103
00:03:58,417 --> 00:04:01,417
My, my, all these toys
left lying around

104
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,625
sure are making it difficult
to keep the balloon up.

105
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:05,875
We know!

106
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:09,333
Can you imagine how easy
this would be

107
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:11,500
if you'd tidied them all away?

108
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,125
That isn't helping!

109
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:14,375
Oh, no!

110
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:16,583
-Ooh!
-Ooh!

111
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:17,875
Ha ha! See, Dad?

112
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,125
Our toys saved the balloon.

113
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:21,709
Not for long!

114
00:04:21,792 --> 00:04:23,250
-No!
-No!

115
00:04:25,917 --> 00:04:27,417
- You get it!
-Yah!

116
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,500
Aah!

117
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:29,834
It's heading
for the fan!

118
00:04:29,917 --> 00:04:31,542
Oh, no!

119
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:34,667
Oh, no!

120
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,834
-We can't let it touch the ground!

121
00:04:37,917 --> 00:04:39,083
-We know!
-We know!

122
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:40,166
-Bwut!

123
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,458
No, I mean, we really can't
let it touch the ground.

124
00:04:43,542 --> 00:04:45,917
Balloons pop
if they touch grass!

125
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,166
What?
You said nothing would happen!

126
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,083
It's my last balloon!

127
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,291
Catch it!

128
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:52,291
-Aah!
-Aah!

129
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,917
- Aah! Aah!

130
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,834
It's going
into Lucky's yard!

131
00:04:58,834 --> 00:04:59,959
Lucky, the balloon!

132
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:00,959
Get it, Lucky!

133
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,583
Got it! Bwut!

134
00:05:02,667 --> 00:05:04,125
Aah! Lucky!

135
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,333
I'm not gonna make it!

136
00:05:05,417 --> 00:05:06,333
Oh, no!

137
00:05:06,417 --> 00:05:07,917
Mine! Mine!

138
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:10,542
Yours, Lucky! Get onto it!

139
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,792
Good one, Dad.
I got it, I got it!

140
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:14,333
-That's it, boy!

141
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:16,959
I got it! Mine!

142
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:19,834
Oh, I've done me hammy.

143
00:05:19,917 --> 00:05:20,917
You get it, Lucky.

144
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,208
Lucky, get it!

145
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:24,458
-Okay, Bluey!

146
00:05:24,542 --> 00:05:26,500
Yah! There ya go, Bluey!

147
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,000
Thanks, Lucky's Dad!

148
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:29,542
No worries, Bluey.

149
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,500
I can catch it. I can catch it!

150
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:32,834
Catch it, Mum!

151
00:05:32,917 --> 00:05:34,917
Looks like rain!

152
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:41,041
-No!
-No!

153
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:43,500
Ohh.

154
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,458
Aw, my balloon.

155
00:05:45,542 --> 00:05:47,291
It's popped.

156
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:49,917
It's all good.
We can blow up another one.

157
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,667
But that was my last balloon.

158
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,041
Oh.

159
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:56,709
Did I make that
a little too fun?

160
00:05:56,834 --> 00:05:58,834
-Yes.
-Yeah, you did.

161
00:05:59,834 --> 00:06:01,000
Sorry, squirts.

162
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:02,583
It's a hard one to get right.

163
00:06:06,792 --> 00:06:08,125
It was pretty fun, though.

164
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:10,792
Yeah,
it was definitely quite fun.

165
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,709
Yeah, it was really fun.

166
00:06:12,792 --> 00:06:17,125
You know, I think we've got
one last balloon left.

167
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,083
- Really?
-For real life?

168
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:21,750
Yeah... a big blue one.

169
00:06:21,834 --> 00:06:23,709
Uh-oh.

170
00:06:27,834 --> 00:06:29,500
Blow up the Daddy balloon!

171
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:32,417
-Yeah!

172
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,625
Ready!

173
00:06:33,792 --> 00:06:35,834
Shall we play keepy uppy?

174
00:06:35,917 --> 00:06:37,166
Unh-unh!

175
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,000
Ohh.

176
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:40,542
What? What?

177
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,000
Go free, birdie!

178
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:43,417
Pbhhhhhhhht!

179
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:55,959
Oh, no!
