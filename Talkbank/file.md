This is the link to the talk bank data: https://git.talkbank.org/childes

So, I want you to create a scrapper that will scrape the files from the talkbank data and save them to a local directory.
Currently, I want everything, but but my current priority is to get the data for the childes corpus.

This is the root of the directory: https://git.talkbank.org/

The content are zip files, the unzipped content are .cha files. I'm not sure what to do with these yet, but I want you to hold onto them for now.
