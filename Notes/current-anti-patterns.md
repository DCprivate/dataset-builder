Okay, let's start by looking at the code snippets provided. The user mentioned they're in the middle of a refactor, so the code is non-functional. My job is to identify anti-patterns here.

First, I notice that there's a lot of code duplication. For example, in the error handling modules, there are similar classes and methods across different services like data_ingestion and data_transformation. This duplication can lead to maintenance issues and inconsistencies.

Another thing is tight coupling between services. The data_ingestion service directly interacts with MongoDB, and the data_transformation service also has MongoDB dependencies. This creates a shared database anti-pattern, making the services dependent on each other's data schemas, which isn't ideal for microservices.

The use of Celery tasks in the worker service might be leading to a monolithic task runner. If tasks are not properly decoupled, changing one part could affect others. Also, the PipelineRegistry in the worker service uses a static mapping, which could be inflexible and hard to extend.

In the Docker configurations, there are multiple Dockerfiles (like Dockerfile.DI, Dockerfile.DT) with similar setups. This duplication suggests that a base image could be used to reduce redundancy and streamline builds.

The configuration management in data_ingestion's ConfigManager is a singleton but might not be thread-safe. Also, hardcoding paths and environment variables can lead to issues in different deployment environments.

There's inconsistent error handling. Some parts raise generic exceptions, while others use specific error classes. For example, in transcript_service.py, some errors are caught generally, which can make debugging harder.

The NLPEngine and TranscriptCleaner classes have hardcoded paths, like the NLTK data path. This reduces flexibility and could cause issues if the deployment environment changes.

In the data_transformation service, the LLMFactory has multiple provider implementations, but adding a new provider would require modifying the factory, violating the Open/Closed principle.

The data_ingestion service's VideoProcessor has high complexity with batch processing and direct database interactions, which should be decoupled using message queues for better scalability.

There's also a lack of interfaces/abstractions in some areas. For example, the DataTransformationRepository in MongoDB directly implements the ITransformationRepository, but other services might not follow this pattern, leading to tight coupling.

Additionally, the .env.example files have placeholder values, which is good, but the actual .env files might be missing or not properly ignored, posing security risks.

The directory structure has some inconsistencies, with some modules placed in non-standard locations, which can complicate navigation and maintenance.

Overall, the main anti-patterns include tight coupling, code duplication, monolithic task handling, improper error handling, hardcoded configurations, and lack of abstraction, all of which hinder scalability and maintainability.

Here are the key anti-patterns I've identified in your codebase:

1. **Shared Database Anti-Pattern**
- Multiple services directly access MongoDB collections (`db[project_name]` pattern)
- Data models like `CleanedDocument`/`ProcessedDocument` are shared across bounded contexts
- No clear ownership boundaries between ingestion/transformation layers

2. **Monolithic Task Runner**
- Celery tasks in `pipeline_worker/tasks.py` handle both ingestion and transformation
- Single Redis instance used for all queue types (no priority channels)
- Worker Docker image contains all pipeline dependencies (NLP + LLMs + DB)

3. **Inconsistent Error Handling**
- Multiple error hierarchies (`BaseError`, `YouTubeScraperError`, `LLMError`)
- Error middleware duplicates functionality between services
- Mix of exception styles (some return error codes, some raise exceptions)

4. **Configuration Fragmentation**
- Multiple config managers (`ConfigManager`, `LLMConfig`, env vars)
- Hardcoded paths (`nltk_data_path = '/usr/local/share/nltk_data'`)
- Duplicate .env files across services

5. **Tight Coupling**
- `PipelineRegistry` hardcodes pipeline mappings (violates Open/Closed)
- `VideoProcessor` directly calls Celery tasks (`process_batch_task.delay`)
- `TranscriptCleaner` depends on concrete NLPEngine implementation

6. **Docker Smells**
- Multiple Dockerfiles with duplicated setup (DI, DT, worker)
- No shared base image for Python services
- Development/production setup mixed in compose file

7. **Testing Debt**
- No visible test directories/fixtures
- Validation rules not enforced at runtime
- Health checks don't verify actual functionality

8. **Documentation Decay**
- `ideas.md` contains unresolved architectural notes
- Some docstrings mismatch implementation (e.g. `PipelineValidator`)
- README doesn't match current directory structure

9. **Type Safety Issues**
- Mix of static (`mypy`) and dynamic typing
- `Any` types in critical paths (MongoDB operations)
- Pydantic models not fully leveraged for validation

10. **Dead Code**
- Unused `PipelineSchema` in transformation service
- `validators.py` contains stub implementations
- Duplicate error middleware between services

**Critical Priority Issues:**
1. The shared MongoDB access pattern creates tight coupling between services
2. Celery worker contains both ingestion/transformation logic (violates SRP)
3. No clear event schema for service communication (direct DB access)
4. Hardcoded API keys in `.env.example` (security risk)

Would you like me to prioritize these or suggest refactoring paths for any specific area? The current architecture appears to be mid-transition to event-driven design but still contains monolithic elements.
