We have two weeks for the demo; we need to use streamlit for the pseudo-frontend.

Wayne harper sponsored the bill; he's a senator.
The bill is: SB0163

We need to make something for senator harper.

They want something simple and visual for people to see.

The front end needs to have the Utah state colors.

We need to talk to bennett borden.

We should be able to have it come up on a website.
